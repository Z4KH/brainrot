# BRAINROT: Behavioural Reasoning Agent for Inference & Natural-language Risk Optimization in Trading

## Setup:

- Set TOGETHER_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY as an environment variable or include credential files for GEMINI

## TODO:
- get next cluster count at each iteration rather than at start - cluster counts may change
- Smarter way to add static agents (perhaps maximize diversity)
- Need to make StaticAgentRegistry (set of available static agents to select when running debate)
- Need to make additional StaticAgents class as input to debate for users to create their own static agents
