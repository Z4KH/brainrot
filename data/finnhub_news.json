Wild movements in the bond market have been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street in 2025. In part, the climb in yields on US debt has reflected rising concerns about the country\u2019s fiscal position. Those worries have now been compounded by a new Trump tax bill that promises to add trillions to the US\u2019s already bloated deficit. While professionals say investors haven\u2019t lost trust in the US\u2019s ability to honor its debt, they will continue to demand higher yields to compensate for the rising risk. That could have major ramifications in markets for everything from the demand for Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) stock to housing. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with BlackRock (BLK) Global Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income Rick Rieder, one of the top minds in the bond market. Rieder reveals his latest thinking on fixed income as he manages $2.7 trillion in assets at BlackRock. Rieder also weighs in on the outlook for stocks in the face of what could be higher interest rates for longer from the Federal Reserve.

The company is one of the biggest players in the chip industry, supplying products to Apple (AAPL) to power its iPhone and to automakers to power their increasingly digital cockpits. The company's market cap stands at an impressive $163 billion. At the helm as CEO since 2021 is 30-year Qualcomm veteran Cristiano Amon, who started at the company as an engineer. Amon has been moving aggressively to diversify the business away from Apple into areas such as industrial applications and, more recently, data centers. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Amon to discuss the next 40 years for Qualcomm. Amon is fresh off a trip to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump and other top tech executives. Amon secured a key memorandum of understanding to help Saudi Arabia build out AI data centers. Sozzi and Amon discuss the trip and what greater trade tensions mean for Qualcomm's important China business. Last year, China represented 46% of Qualcomm's sales.
