    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently auctioning near our level of 595.14. For the bulls to maintain control, we want to see a firm move higher toward 596.57. If buyers can sustain momentum above 596.57, we will be watching for them to bring the auction up to 598.04. Should 598.04 establish as dependable support, the path could open for buyers to press toward 599.24. If demand remains strong through the session, we would look for the price to challenge the high bull target of 600.51.\n\nIf 595.14 loses footing as support, the bears may start pushing toward 593.73. Should we see sellers take charge there, the next lower test would likely come in at 592.00. If this level sees further weakness and breaks down, the door opens for sellers to target deeper support at 589.71. In an aggressive downside scenario today, we would monitor for potential drives toward the low bear target at 587.31.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nThe QQQ is currently auctioning around 527.03. For bulls to keep momentum, we'd like to see price action step up above 528.44 and hold that level securely. If buyers control that zone, the next target would be 530.70 as an important support zone. Should the auction remain strong, advancing further upside to 532.52 would be on watch. If bullish enthusiasm continues, a push toward 533.70 is possible, with an ultimate high bull target today at 534.60.\n\nIf bulls fail to maintain ground above 527.03, bears may look to press the auction down toward 525.19. Should this level give way, further selling could drive a test toward 523.91. Continued downward momentum would bring 522.57 into play as key support. If this fails under sustained pressure, the low bear target for today would be a move to 521.15.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is currently auctioning around 202.29. For bulls to gain traction, we want to see them push the price above 203.48 and establish that as support. Continued buying momentum could then take the auction up toward 204.33. If bulls can maintain strength above there, we'd look for further movement to 205.54. In a strong buy-side session, Apple could climb toward the high bull target at 206.55. If 202.29 cannot be defended as support, bears are likely to probe lower toward 200.53.\n\nIf selling pressure persists there, we'd anticipate a test at 199.51. Continued downside action could then see a move toward 198.79. Should sellers dominate the session, a potential move toward the low bear target at 198.22 would be in focus.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is currently auctioning around 469.28. For bulls to stay in control, they need to see price climb and hold above 469.94. If this level becomes support, we expect the auction to push toward 470.77. Continued strength above that zone could invite buyers to target 472.11. If momentum builds through the session, the high bull target for Microsoft today is set at 472.91.\n\nIf 469.28 cannot hold firm during the session, we would expect bears to initiate a move lower toward 468.61. If this level breaks under selling pressure, the next downside test would likely come at 467.65. Continued weakness could expose 466.44 to sellers. In a heavy selling environment, bears may aim for a move toward the low bear target of 464.70.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is currently auctioning around the key level of 140.28. For bulls to control the tape, they will want to push price above 141.21 and confirm it as support. A hold above this level could lead to an advance toward 142.35. If buyers continue to show strength, we'd expect a rally toward 144.21. The high bull target for NVIDIA today stands at 145.61.\n\nIf 140.28 does not hold as support, the bears may look to test down toward 139.42. If selling builds momentum below that level, the next key support would come into play at 138.55. Continued downside action could bring 137.94 into focus. If the session unfolds with heavy selling, the low bear target of 136.98 would be the next area to watch.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently auctioning near our level of 169.34. For buyers to remain in control, they will need to hold 169.34 and work the auction higher toward 171.14. If bullish momentum persists above that level, we would look for a potential move toward 172.28, which is today's high bull target for Alphabet.\n\nIf the auction cannot maintain support at 169.34, we'd expect bears to press down toward 167.04. A breakdown of this level would open the door for sellers to test 165.41. If selling remains aggressive, the bears may ultimately target the low bear level of 163.79.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc META\n\nMeta is currently auctioning near 689.09. For bulls to retain control, we'd like to see 689.09 hold as a solid support zone and for the auction to push higher toward 692.10. Should that level convert to support, the next area we'd monitor is 695.62. If the buy-side remains dominant, today's high bull target is set at 699.93.\n\nIf bulls cannot keep 689.09 supported, bears could take advantage and drive the auction lower toward 683.97. If this level gives way under pressure, we'd look for sellers to test 679.79. Should further downside occur, the bears could target 676.46 as the low bear level for today's session.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is currently auctioning near 296.44. If bulls want to stay in charge, they will need to push price toward 298.28. If momentum holds above there, the next target would be a move toward 300.56. If buying pressure accelerates, we'd expect a test of 304.24, with the high bull target today standing at 310.17.\n\nIf the 296.44 level fails to act as support, bears are likely to test the next downside level at 294.60. If that zone is breached, sellers may drive the auction toward 293.21. Continued weakness could open the path for a deeper move toward 290.47, which marks today's low bear target for Tesla.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nThis morning brings a critical data point with the release of May's Non-Farm Payrolls report at 8:30 AM ET. Along with it, markets will digest the latest figures on unemployment, labor force participation, and average hourly earnings, all of which could sharply impact sentiment. In the afternoon, we will also see April's Consumer Credit data at 3 PM ET.\n\nExpect volatility to be elevated today, especially during the opening auction and into any potential post-data reactions. It will be important to stay nimble, as key levels may get tested on both sides of the tape. Also remain alert to any breaking headlines that could amplify moves throughout the session.

    "data": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.\n\nDrooling To Drive Stock Market To New Highs\n\nPlease click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.\n\nNote the following:\n\nFirst and foremost, our report is politically agnostic. Please read the following in the spirit that the purpose is to help you get ahead of the curve by cutting through all of the political noise.\n\nThe chart shows our calls to raise cash and hedges the last time the market was near this level.\n\nThe chart shows our buy signals near the Liberation Day lows.\n\nThe chart shows the market is now approaching the prior 2025 high.\n\nThe chart shows the market is at the bottom band of zone 1 (resistance).\n\nPresident Trump's latest proposal has momo gurus drooling. President Trump's proposal is to entirely scrap the debt limit. The U.S. government borrows and spends like a drunken sailor. Imagine giving a drunken sailor a credit card with no limit.\n\nIn our analysis, entirely scraping the debt limit will dramatically increase reckless spending by the government. Further, in our analysis, such reckless spending, if it becomes a reality, will drive the stock market dramatically higher in the short term. The consequences will be devastating in the long term.\n\nIf President Trump's latest proposal is enacted, our tentative plan will be to bring our Protection Band near zero, aggressively invest in the stock market, and subsequently sell into the strength and ultimately raise our Protection Band to 100% to protect against the long term negative consequences.\n\nIn our analysis, if the proposal is enacted, down the road, there will be the best opportunity ever to make a fortune by short selling.\n\nPresident Trump's latest proposal to scrap the debt limit has support from many Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren. The only obstacle in the way is a handful of Republicans who are part of the rapidly vanishing species who want fiscal responsibility.\n\nIn a surprise, the vanishing breed of Republicans have just gained a powerful ally in First Buddy Elon Musk. Previously, Elon Musk alienated Democrats by spending $250M to support President Trump's campaign. Now, Musk is alienating President Trump and most Republicans by coming out swinging against the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\". In a direct challenge to President Trump, Musk said, \"Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.\" Please see yesterday's Morning Capsule for background. Musk is now getting hate from both Democrats and Republicans. Both Republicans and Democrats cannot believe that Musk has the audacity to say, \"We should not take American prosperity for granted. We have to reduce the size of government, reduce spending, and live within our means.\"\n\nWarren Buffett's wisdom shows in a proposal he made in 2011. His proposal was that if the deficit goes over 3% of the GDP, all sitting members of Congress would become ineligible for re-election. Prudent investors should note \u2013 Senator Mike Lee has just announced he is drafting an amendment that would deem members of Congress ineligible for re-election if the deficit is more than 3% of GDP. Musk has endorsed this amendment.\n\nMusk has endorsed this amendment. The \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" passed by the House already has a $4T increase in the debt limit. If the Senate passes the bill, it will be the largest ever increase in the debt limit in a single bill.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" will increase the deficit by $2.4T.\n\nInitial jobless claims came at 247K vs. 235K consensus. The increase in jobless claims is a negative for the stock market. However, President Trump's latest proposal is overshadowing this negative development. Initial jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in the adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model. Adaptive means the model automatically changes itself based on market conditions.\n\nThe official jobs report will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.\n\nAs of this writing, aggressive buying is coming in the stock market on a Chinese state media report that President Trump and President Xi of China had a phone call.\n\nEurope\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates to 2% after inflation fell below the target in May.\n\nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), and Apple Inc (AAPL).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Tesla Inc (TSLA).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ).\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is range bound.\n\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently trading near the 596.57 level. For the bulls, we want to see buyers drive the price above 598.04. If strength continues above this area, the next key level to watch is 599.24. Holding 599.24 as support could open the door for buyers to push toward 600.51. If momentum remains on the buy side, the high bull target on the day sits at 601.22.\n\nShould 596.57 give way during today's session, we will be watching for sellers to challenge 595.14. If bears continue to press lower, a move toward 593.73 would be likely. Further downside action could see 592.00 tested next. If the session sees heavy selling, the low bear target to monitor for SPY is 589.71.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is currently hovering near the 528.44 level. Bulls want to see this level sustained with strength and buyers stepping in to reclaim 530.70 as firm support. If buyers maintain momentum, the next upside target is 532.52. Continued bullish follow-through may bring a move toward 533.70, with the high bull target for today set at 534.60.\n\nIf 528.44 weakens during regular trading hours, look for bears to gain control and test 527.03. A further decline could see price move toward 525.19. If the downtrend accelerates, expect sellers to probe 523.91. Breaking that level could pave the way for a move down to the low bear target of 522.57.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is currently auctioning near the 202.29 level. For buyers, we are watching to see if they can lift the price to hold above 203.48. Continued bullish strength could push price action up to 204.33. If buyers remain active, a move toward 205.54 is possible, with the high bull target today at 206.55.\n\nIf Apple struggles to maintain 202.29 as support, we anticipate a potential test down toward 200.53. If selling continues to pick up, the next level to watch will be 199.51. Persistent downside momentum could bring 198.79 into play, with the low bear target for the session sitting at 198.22.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is currently auctioning around the 463.27 level. Bulls are looking for sustained buying to push above this area and establish support at 464.70. Holding that level could lead to a move toward 466.44. If buying pressure remains strong, the high bull target for today is set at 467.65.\n\nIf 463.27 fails to hold as support, we anticipate a move down to test 462.07. Should the bears remain in control, look for further weakness toward 460.78. A break below that could drive price action down toward 459.18, with the low bear target for Microsoft resting at 457.25.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is currently trading near our key level of 141.21. Bulls want to see a move higher toward 142.35 and a firm hold of that level as new support. If buying continues, the next target to the upside is 144.21. Should momentum stay positive, we could see NVIDIA approach 145.61, with the high bull target today at 147.06.\n\nIf 141.21 cannot hold as support, we expect sellers to press toward 140.28. Continued downside movement could bring the auction to test 139.42. If weakness persists, the next level to watch is 138.55. A strong move lower would have the bears targeting the session low at 137.94.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently trading around the 169.34 level. Bulls will look to build support here and push price higher toward 171.14. If the buying effort continues to drive the tape, the high bull target for today is 172.28.\n\nShould 169.34 fail to act as support, sellers will likely look to move the price down to 167.04. If that level is broken, look for the bears to target 165.41. Continued downside could bring Alphabet to test the low bear target on the day at 163.79.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is currently auctioning around the 689.09 level. Bulls want to see this level hold with strength, allowing buyers to push the price toward 692.10. If momentum builds, the next target for bulls is 695.62. A sustained rally could bring Meta toward the high bull target of 699.93.\n\nIf 689.09 loses support during today's session, sellers will likely press the auction lower to 683.97. Continued selling could test the next level at 679.79. If this level also breaks, the bears will aim for the low bear target today at 676.46.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is currently trading near the 322.52 level. Buyers will want to push price action higher toward 327.59. If this level is secured, further upside could target 333.93. In the event of a broader market rally, Tesla could push toward 340.97, with the high bull target today set at 346.64.\n\nIf 322.52 breaks to the downside, we'll be watching for a test of 315.93. If selling pressure builds, expect sellers to press toward 312.42. A breakdown below this level could drive the auction lower toward the low bear target of 310.17.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday's session brings several key economic reports to the forefront. At 8:30AM ET, we will see the release of Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims, April's Trade Balance, and the final Q1 readings for Non-Farm Productivity and Unit Labor Costs. Additionally, the Fed speaker calendar is active today with Kugler at 12PM ET, followed by Harker and Schmid at 1:30PM ET. Expect these events to generate periods of heightened market volatility, particularly as traders gauge the Fed's ongoing policy tone.\n\nWith a full slate of catalysts on deck and markets sitting at key technical levels, today's trading could see strong directional movement. Be prepared for volatility around the data releases and Fed commentary. Stay disciplined, follow your trade plan, and manage your risk carefully throughout the session. Good luck today!\n\nStart your day with a live daily market analysis, a carefully selected watch list, early access to the Morning Memo, and exclusive Market Clubhouse price levels, providing precise support and resistance indicators.

This indicates that there is room for the stock market to move to zone 1, but the stock market can also pull back due to overbought conditions.\n\nElon Musk is calling President Trump's budget a \"disgusting abomination.\" Musk says, \"Congress is making America bankrupt.\" Musk claims that President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" will massively increase the budget deficit to $2.5T. The momo crowd buys Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock on every comment from Musk. How is the momo crowd reacting to Musk's comment about President Trump's budget? The momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks as the pull of the zone 1 magnet in the stock market is much stronger than Musk's influence. Prudent investors should pay attention to Musk's comment about President Trump's budget. After all, Musk spent $250M of his own money to get Trump elected and countless hours in Washington on DOGE to help President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump said, \"I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\" How does the momo crowd react to President Trump's statement? The momo crowd is buying stocks because President Trump likes President Xi, and they are ignoring President Trump saying that President Xi is extremely hard to make a deal with. Prudent investors should not ignore half of President Trump's statement.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing Inc (ADP) is the largest private payroll processor in the country. ADP data poured cold water on all the bullishness. ADP showed employment much weaker than expected. ADP Employment Change came at 37K vs. 115K consensus. Weak ADP data brought quick selling to the stock market, but as of this writing, the momo crowd is aggressively buying the shallow dip caused by the ADP data.\n\n(ADP) is the largest private payroll processor in the country.

JOLTS data contributed to yesterday's stock market rally.\n\nInitial jobless claims will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET and the official jobs report will be released Friday at 8:30am ET.\n\nISM Services was released today at 10am ET. ISM Services data can cause major moves in the markets.

The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nOil\n\nAPI crude inventories came at a draw of 3.3M barrels vs. a consensus of a draw of 0.9M barrels. This data is bearish for oil, but new politics will trump any data.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is range bound.\n\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently trading around our identified pivot at 596.57. For bullish momentum, buyers should initially aim to reclaim 598.04. Sustained strength above this mark would position SPY for a test at our next crucial level of 599.24. If buyers successfully secure this level during regular hours, expect upward momentum towards 600.51, with the day\u2019s upper bullish target at 601.22.\n\nShould 596.57 fail to maintain support, sellers will likely drive the action towards 595.14. Persistent bearish pressure would subsequently target 593.73. If selling intensifies significantly at that level, expect a deeper decline towards robust support at 592.00, and if market weakness escalates further, our downside bearish target would be set at 589.71.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nThe QQQ is presently trading around our significant level at 528.44. Bulls need to confidently secure this point and advance towards a confirmed support at 530.70. Ongoing bullish sentiment could drive prices higher to 532.52, and a further surge might facilitate a test at 533.70. Our optimistic target on the upside today for QQQ is pegged at 534.60.\n\nConversely, if buyers struggle to sustain price above 528.44, bears are expected to take command, targeting a decline towards 527.03. A continued push lower may challenge support at 525.19. Under heavy selling conditions, 523.91 would come into focus, with heightened bearish activity potentially driving prices down to today\u2019s bearish target at 522.57.\n\nApple Inc. ( AAPL)\n\nApple is currently auctioning around the pivotal area of 202.29. Bulls aim to establish support firmly at 203.48, paving the way for further advances toward 204.33. If momentum persists, the price could accelerate upwards to 205.54, potentially culminating at today\u2019s bullish objective of 206.55.\n\nIf Apple fails to sustain the current level at 202.29, bearish traders will likely press downward to test 200.53. Continued sell-side action would further push prices toward 199.51. Persistent selling pressure could challenge 198.79, and breaking this level decisively may drive Apple toward our low-end bearish target of 198.22.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading near our crucial area of 462.07. Bullish participants need to firmly reclaim the level of 463.27 to bolster a push higher towards 464.70. Sustained momentum above this critical threshold would likely propel prices upward to test 466.44, and continued buyer enthusiasm may reach our high-end bullish target at 467.65.\n\nOn the downside, inability to hold 462.07 as reliable support would open the door for bearish traders to target 460.78 initially. Further selling could see prices move towards 459.18. If selling pressure intensifies significantly, expect a deeper probe downward towards 457.25, ultimately aiming for today\u2019s bearish downside target at 455.77.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA)\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nNVIDIA is trading near our key level at 142.35. For the bulls, the immediate goal is securing a move upwards toward 144.21, establishing clear support. Should buyer activity remain robust, anticipate further gains toward 145.61, and continued bullish strength might elevate the price toward 147.06, with today\u2019s optimistic bullish target set at 148.52.\n\nIf 142.35 fails to hold as dependable support today, sellers will target 141.21 initially. Persistent bearish momentum could push NVIDIA down toward 140.28. Intensifying selling pressure could lead to testing the lower boundary at 139.42, with extreme bearish action potentially driving price to our low target for NVIDIA at 138.55.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is trading near our pivotal level of 167.04. Buyers aim to secure firm support at 169.34 to facilitate an advance towards 171.14. Continued bullish sentiment could drive the price higher, targeting today\u2019s bullish objective at 172.28.\n\nConversely, a failure to maintain 167.04 as reliable support could see sellers pushing prices down toward 165.41. Further selling may intensify a decline toward 163.79. Under significant bearish momentum, Alphabet could test today\u2019s bearish target level at 161.79.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is currently auctioning around our level of interest at 671.80. Bullish traders must hold firm support here and target upward momentum toward 676.46. Continued buying strength might propel prices towards 679.79, and sustained bullish action could potentially achieve today\u2019s upper bullish target at 683.97.\n\nShould 671.80 not hold as stable support, sellers will likely push lower toward 667.99. Additional downside momentum could bring 663.33 into focus. If bearish pressure deepens significantly, prices might continue downward to test today\u2019s low-end bearish objective at 658.86.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is currently trading around our key price zone at 346.64. Buyers should aim to propel the price upwards initially toward 350.87. Persistent bullish sentiment could lift prices further toward 356.80. If broader market strength prevails, expect a potential test higher at 363.84, with a strong influx of buyers possibly achieving today\u2019s bullish target at 370.22.\n\nOn the flip side, a failure at 346.64 would likely induce selling pressure, targeting a decline initially toward 340.97. Continued bearish activity could bring 333.93 into play. If sellers significantly overwhelm buying interest, anticipate Tesla descending toward our bearish downside target at 327.59.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday\u2019s economic calendar features key releases beginning at 8:15AM ET with the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change for May, providing early insight into labor market strength.

It is especially important for the U.S. because the U.S. owes its prosperity, in large part, to the dollar being the world's reserve currency. If the dollar falls further, it will be very negative for the U.S. in the long term. The short term is a different story. The momo crowd will celebrate the fall in the dollar by buying stocks. The S&P 500 has a large number of multinational companies. When earnings from overseas are translated into dollars, earnings will have the appearance of going up. Less knowledgeable investors will buy into higher earnings and aggressively buy stocks. In the short term, the stock market will likely go up. In the longer term, a fall in the dollar will be devastating. As always, as members of our report, you will be able to act in advance to protect and grow your wealth. It is important to build your knowledge ahead of time, so that if such a time comes, you will be ready to act with conviction.\n\nOf note for prudent investors is that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered the growth forecast for the world and for the U.S. OECD is a highly respected Paris based organization of 38 countries with the mission to promote growth and stability. OECD is citing tariffs as the trigger to reduce its forecast. U.S. growth is projected to drop to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. As a reference, the prior forecast was 2.2% and the U.S. grew by 2.8% in 2024. The global growth forecast is being reduced to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026. As a reference, global growth was 3.3% in 2024.\n\nFor the time being, the stock market is oblivious as the following three factors dominate: Blind money flowing into the stock market Aggressively buying by the momo crowd Wall Street doubling up on TACO trade (Trump Always Chickens Out)\n\nThe stock market has correctly figured out that, at this time, President Trump is sensitive to the stock market. The White House is going out of its way to create hope. The latest hope driving buying in the stock market is President Trump pushing to have a phone call with President Xi of China.\n\nAlso driving buying in the stock market is President Trump giving several countries a deadline to submit their best trade proposals.\n\nAdding to the buying in the stock market is President Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" heading to the Senate. The momo crowd is excited about tax cuts, higher government spending resulting in higher deficits, and higher government borrowing. The momo crowd believes that all of these will take the stock market to a new high. The hopium is S&P 500 going to 7000 quickly.\n\nThe problem for all of the bullishness in the stock market is that the bond market and the dollar may get in the way. Unlike the stock market, the bond market and the currency market are very concerned about the higher deficit and higher borrowing that will result from President Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"\n\nIn important news, especially for AI, at its annual meeting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd . (TSM) CEO C.C. Wei is very bullish and believes tariffs will not impact TSM as the company will be able to pass them on. TSM is important because it is the main manufacturer of chips for companies such as NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Apple Inc (AAPL), and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM).\n\n.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently trading around the critical level at 592.00. Bulls should ideally push prices upward toward 593.73 initially. If buyers can firmly establish control above this zone, we anticipate a move up to the next important area of 595.14. A sustained buying presence above this mark during the regular session could further propel the auction toward 596.57. Continued bullish momentum places our upper bullish target at 598.04 for today.\n\nShould sellers dominate and SPY fail to sustain 592.00, we expect downward pressure to initially target 589.71. Persistent selling at that point could bring further decline to the next support at 587.31. If bears break decisively through this support, look for more aggressive selling toward 585.75. Our bearish target, in the event of significant selling pressure today, stands at 584.68.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nThe Q\u2019s are currently positioned near the critical pivot of 522.57. Bulls will need to maintain this price level firmly to fuel a bullish momentum towards 523.91, turning it into reliable support. Should buyers sustain their strength here, we anticipate an advance to 525.19. Further upward conviction today would open a likely test of 527.03, with our top bullish objective for the session at 528.44.\n\nConversely, if 522.57 proves vulnerable and sellers regain control, anticipate a decline to the downside toward 521.15. Continued selling would prompt further downward pressure targeting 519.87. Should bearish intensity persist, we expect a deeper test at 518.65, and ultimately, a potential extension toward our bearish objective at 517.97.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is currently hovering near our key level at 202.29. Bulls aim to confidently reclaim and hold 203.48 as immediate support, triggering an upward push toward 204.33. Sustained bullish control beyond this point would further elevate the auction toward 205.54. Strong bullish momentum today could see Apple testing our primary bullish target at 206.55.\n\nIf 202.29 fails to hold under selling pressure, expect an initial bearish drive toward 200.53. Ongoing weakness may result in a deeper slide to 199.51. Intensified selling would then challenge support at 198.79, and if broken decisively, Apple could approach our bearish objective today at 198.22.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is trading around our strategic level at 462.07. For a bullish outlook, we seek a firm hold above 463.27, prompting upward momentum to target 464.70 as stable support during market hours. Consistent buying strength above this point would likely trigger a rally toward 466.44, with further bullish continuation setting our day\u2019s primary bullish target at 467.65.\n\nShould 462.07 fail to withstand bearish pressure, we anticipate an initial push downward toward 460.78. Breaking below this point would likely prompt further selling to test 459.18. Increased bearish momentum would bring a deeper correction targeting 457.25. Under significant selling pressure today, Microsoft\u2019s bearish target rests at 455.77.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is currently auctioning near our pivotal level at 137.94. For a bullish scenario, the auction needs to reclaim and solidify 138.55 as support, which would then pave the way for upward movement toward 139.42. Persistent bullish buying activity could further elevate price action towards 140.28, ultimately driving towards our day\u2019s bullish target of 141.21.\n\nConversely, if sellers take control and NVIDIA fails to defend 137.94, anticipate initial bearish movement targeting 136.98. If selling escalates, the next support at 135.64 will come into play. Further weakness could see prices slipping toward 134.56, and a break below this support may trigger a drop to today\u2019s bearish target at 133.31.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is trading near our significant level at 169.34. Bulls aim to reclaim and hold 171.14 as immediate support, driving prices upward towards 172.28. Sustained buying interest could further elevate the auction, aiming at today\u2019s top bullish target at 174.01.\n\nShould selling pressure undermine 169.34, anticipate a bearish drive toward 167.04. Continued bearish momentum would target the next lower support at 165.41. Heavy selling activity below this level could extend the bearish scenario down toward today\u2019s bearish target at 163.79.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc META\n\nMeta is currently trading near our pivotal level at 671.80. Bulls will want to maintain strength above this level and firmly hold it as support, setting the stage for a rise toward 676.46. Continued bullish momentum could push prices upward to 679.79, with a strong rally targeting our day\u2019s bullish high of 683.97.\n\nIf Meta cannot hold 671.80, anticipate bearish pressure to initially push prices downward toward 667.99. Continued selling strength could test lower support levels around 663.33. Intensified bearish pressure would target deeper declines toward today\u2019s bearish low at 658.86.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is currently positioned around our essential pivot at 340.97. Bulls aim to propel prices upward initially toward 346.64. Continued buying activity could lead to a significant push higher towards 350.87. If market conditions broadly favor buyers today, expect Tesla to rally even further towards 356.80, with bullish sentiment potentially reaching our day\u2019s top bullish target of 363.84.\n\nIf sellers regain dominance and Tesla breaks below 340.97, anticipate an initial bearish test toward 333.93. Ongoing selling pressure could expose further downside towards 327.59. Decisive bearish action below this level would bring prices toward today\u2019s bearish target at 322.52.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday\u2019s economic calendar features several critical data points starting at 10AM ET, including the Factory Orders, Durable Goods Orders, and Capital Goods Orders for April, released simultaneously with the highly influential JOLTS Job Openings, Quits, and Layoffs report. Additionally, we\u2019ll get insights from the June TIPP Economic Optimism Index at the same time.\n\nLater, market attention will shift to the Fed Discount Rate Minutes due at 2PM ET, offering insights into potential monetary policy adjustments. Fed officials Goolsbee and Logan are scheduled to speak at 12:45PM ET and 3:30PM ET respectively, potentially adding further volatility. Given the magnitude and potential impact of today\u2019s economic announcements, traders should prepare for elevated market volatility and remain vigilant in managing risk.

The relief rally in bonds helped the stock market rally.\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM , is the world's most respected banker. Dimon has poured gasoline on the fire that is raging in the bond market. Dimon sees a crack in the bond market sometime in the future. Unless there are substantial changes in the U.S. government's borrowing and spending, Dimon sees a reckoning for the U.S.\n\n, is the world's most respected banker. Dimon has poured gasoline on the fire that is raging in the bond market. Dimon sees a crack in the bond market sometime in the future. Unless there are substantial changes in the U.S. government's borrowing and spending, Dimon sees a reckoning for the U.S. In our analysis, Dimon is right, but here is the key for investors \u2013 the timing of the reckoning is not predictable. The government has enough power and money printing abilities to stave off any reckoning for years. However, the bond market has the potential to be very powerful and also has the power to deteriorate quickly. For example, the bond market reacted negatively when the House passed President Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" The reason for the bond market's reaction was that the bill increased the deficit and borrowing. It was the bond market's reaction that prevented the stock market from going to new highs.\n\nHowever, the bond market has the potential to be very powerful and also has the power to deteriorate quickly.

It was the bond market's reaction that prevented the stock market from going to new highs. When the reckoning happens, most investors will likely lose their shirts just like they lost big in 2008 when S&P 500 lost 50%.\n\nSteel stocks such as Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (CLF), Nucor Corp (NUE), and Steel Dynamics Inc (STLD) are surging this morning after President Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%. Steel stocks overseas are plunging. These tariffs are likely to prove catastrophic for steel mills in Canada. The steel industry directly employs 23,000 Canadians and is responsible for another 100,000 jobs indirectly.\n\n(CLF), (NUE), and (STLD) are surging this morning after President Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%.

The steel industry directly employs 23,000 Canadians and is responsible for another 100,000 jobs indirectly. Blind money is the money that pours into the stock market on the first two days of a new month without any analysis and irrespective of market conditions. Most of the blind money is invested in the afternoon. Traders know this and they buy stocks in the morning to sell to blind money at a higher price in the afternoon.\n\nISM Manufacturing Index was released at 10am ET.\n\nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), and Tesla Inc (TSLA).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).\n\nOil\n\nOil is surging on a drone attack by Ukraine on air bases deep inside Russia, including Siberia.\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nOver the weekend, OPEC+ decided to raise production against objections from Russia.\n\nIn our analysis, OPEC+ raising production is helping move oil prices higher because U.S. shale producers may produce less if prices go lower. Moreover, the OPEC+ production increase is inline with expectations.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is range bound.\n\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently trading near our key level of 587.31. If buyers can step in early, we would like to see an initial move toward 589.71. Sustained strength above this area could encourage further upside movement into 592.00. If momentum remains intact through the session, a continued climb could bring 593.73 into play, with a potential test toward 595.14 as the high target for the bulls.\n\nShould 587.31 fail to hold as support, we will be watching for sellers to challenge 585.75. A breakdown below this level could open the door to further weakness toward 584.68. If selling pressure accelerates, 583.18 will be the next level of interest. In an aggressive downside scenario, the bears may aim for a deeper move toward our low target of 581.97.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is currently hovering near 517.97. A firm push above 518.65 would give buyers room to drive price action higher toward 519.87. If the bulls can maintain momentum, we will be watching for a potential move up into 521.15, followed by an advance toward 522.57. If strength persists through the day, the high-side target for QQQ sits at 523.91.\n\nOn the downside, failure to stay above 517.97 could see sellers take initiative and drive price toward 516.58. Continued weakness could expose the 515.00 level, and if bearish momentum grows, 513.64 will be tested. If sellers dominate the tape, our low target for the session is 511.53.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is currently positioned around the 199.51 level. For bulls to gain control, we want to see 200.53 hold as a reliable base. A breakout above this support zone could see the price challenge 202.29. With solid buying pressure, the next upside targets include 203.48 and the high bull target for today at 204.33.\n\nIf the 199.51 level breaks down, we'll look for a test of 198.79. Should selling intensify, Apple could trade lower toward 198.22. Additional weakness could invite a test of 197.69, and in the case of a heavy selloff, the low target for today would be 197.00.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is currently auctioning just above 459.18. A strong hold and lift above this level could drive the price toward 460.78. If buyers can sustain control, 462.07 becomes the next area of focus. A continuation of bullish momentum could lift the auction toward 463.27, which is our high target on the day for MSFT.\n\nShould 459.18 fail to act as support, sellers may press toward 457.25. A break below this could bring 455.77 into view. If downside momentum builds, 453.02 will be the next level to monitor, and the low target for the session would be 450.26.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is currently near 134.56. Bulls would like to reclaim and hold 135.64 as a solid support area. If buyers can establish control, look for a potential advance toward 136.98. Further strength could drive the auction to 137.94, with the day's high-side target sitting at 138.55.\n\nIf 134.56 cannot be defended, a move lower to 133.31 is likely. If this level breaks, 132.19 would be the next key level to watch. Should selling persist, NVIDIA could test 131.42, with the potential to fall toward the low target of 129.53.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently auctioning near 169.34. If bulls can push above and hold 171.14 as support, there is a clear path toward 172.28. Continued upside participation could drive the auction higher toward the high target of 174.01.\n\nOn the downside, failure to stay above 169.34 could open the door to a move toward 167.04. If sellers remain aggressive, 165.41 will be the next level of interest. A heavy round of selling could pull the price further down toward the low target of 163.79.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is currently holding around 642.59. Bulls will need to defend 646.48 as a key support area to initiate a push toward 650.56. If buying momentum builds, price action could extend higher to 655.54, with an eventual test of the high bull target at 658.86.\n\nIf 642.59 is breached, sellers may drag the auction lower toward 635.49. Additional downside momentum could test 629.88, and if this area fails to hold, Meta may visit the low target of 622.01.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is auctioning near 340.97. A bullish move above this level could ignite a rally toward 346.64. Continued buying would likely bring 350.87 into focus, with the potential for an advance toward 356.80. If buyers dominate today's session, the high target for Tesla would be 363.84. If 340.97 cannot hold as a floor, bears could take the auction lower toward 333.93. If downside pressure persists, a test of 327.59 could follow. In the event of strong selling, the low target for Tesla today would be 322.52.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday's session kicks off June with a series of key economic releases and Fed speakers that could influence volatility. At 9:45 AM ET, we'll see the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for May. Then at 10:00 AM ET, the market will digest Construction Spending data for April alongside the ISM Manufacturing Index, including components such as Prices Paid, New Orders, and Employment.\n\nAdditionally, multiple Fed speakers are scheduled: Logan at 10:15 AM, Goolsbee at 12:45 PM, and Fed Chair Powell delivering remarks at 1:00 PM ET. With this stacked lineup and the fresh start to a new trading month, traders should be prepared for potential swings throughout the session. Stay sharp and manage your risk appropriately.

In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is presently trading near our critical marker of 589.71. For an optimistic scenario, bulls should aim to reclaim 592.00 quickly. Should buyers maintain control above this mark, it sets the stage for further advancement to 593.73. Successful stabilization at this level during regular market hours would likely trigger additional upward momentum, targeting 595.14. A bullish surge today could carry SPY toward our ultimate bullish goal at 596.57.\n\nIf bulls fail to defend 589.71 effectively, bearish traders might pressure the price down to the next support at 587.31. Continued downside action at this level may extend the drop further toward 585.75. If selling accelerates aggressively past this point, the market could explore lower support around 584.68. Under extremely bearish conditions, anticipate SPY testing our deep bearish target of 583.18.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nThe QQQ is actively trading close to our pivotal area at 519.87. Bulls will need an assertive drive above 521.15 to establish a supportive base for a push upward to 522.57. A decisive hold here could fuel further bullish advances, targeting 523.91 next. Strong and sustained buying pressure would potentially bring into focus the 525.19 region, and in an exceptionally bullish scenario, QQQ could reach today\u2019s high target of 527.03.\n\nConversely, if 519.87 fails as a stable support, sellers will likely seize control and drive prices lower toward 518.65. A break under this level could intensify bearish momentum, testing the 517.97 zone. Persistent selling pressure here might expose further downside to 516.58, and if bears dominate decisively, the price could reach today's bearish target at 515.00.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is trading around the critical zone at 200.53. Bulls should ideally establish a foothold at 202.29 swiftly, creating a base for additional upward movement towards 203.48. Continued buying would set the stage for an ascent to 204.33. With sustained bullish enthusiasm, Apple could rise further to reach our ambitious bullish target for today at 205.54.\n\nOn the downside, if the 200.53 support fails to hold, bearish traders will likely challenge the lower level at 199.51. A sustained breakdown here would accelerate declines towards 198.79. Extended selling might push prices further down to 198.22, and under heavy bearish activity, Apple might test today's deeper bearish target at 197.69.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft currently trades near our key level of 459.18. For bullish momentum to solidify, buyers must secure price action decisively above this point, pushing upward to 460.78. If this level holds strongly during regular hours, it sets up a further advance toward 462.07. Robust and sustained bullish buying could lift Microsoft to test today\u2019s bullish target at 463.27.\n\nIf bulls lose the 459.18 support, expect bearish pressure to push prices down to 457.25. Increased selling activity below this threshold could lead Microsoft lower to test the next significant support at 455.77. Continuous bearish pressure may deepen the descent to 453.02, and under severe bearish conditions, Microsoft might target the session's bearish low of 450.26.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is hovering around our critical area of 139.42. Bulls need to quickly establish dominance above 140.28, converting it into firm support. With successful buying here, an upward thrust toward 141.21 becomes viable. Sustained bullish momentum might elevate the price to 142.35, and persistent strength could push NVIDIA to our highest bullish aim today at 144.21.\n\nIf the 139.42 support area collapses, bears will target a move downward toward 138.55. Should selling persist at this level, expect further downside toward 137.94. Continued weakness could expose NVIDIA to additional declines, probing 136.98. Heavy and sustained bearish pressure could ultimately guide prices toward our low bearish target of 135.64.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently trading near our crucial support level at 172.28. To maintain bullish sentiment, buyers need to rapidly reclaim and hold this level, aiming higher toward 174.01. Continued bullish activity could foster an ascent to our ultimate bullish target of the day at 175.12.\n\nIf sellers manage to break down the support at 172.28, bearish momentum would likely accelerate toward 171.14. Additional selling pressure here may further expose downside vulnerability, targeting 169.34 initially. A heavy bearish session could drive Alphabet down to test today\u2019s lower bearish target of 167.04.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is actively trading near our important level of 642.59. Bulls need to establish a robust foothold above 646.48 to ignite upward momentum toward 650.56. Strong buyer interest at this point could open doors for a higher ascent to 655.54. Persistent bullish activity might carry Meta to today's bullish apex at 658.86.\n\nIf bulls fail to maintain support at 642.59, expect a bearish shift, driving prices downward toward 635.49. Further selling pressure might see a deeper retreat toward 629.88. A substantial break below this zone could send prices spiraling down to our low bearish target for Meta at 622.01.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla trades close to our pivotal point at 356.80. For upward momentum to gain traction, bulls must aggressively push the price toward 363.84. Sustained buying activity above this could propel Tesla further toward 370.22. Strong market-wide bullishness might carry prices higher still to test 378.79. Exceptional bullish conditions today could elevate Tesla to our highest bullish target at 384.07.\n\nConversely, if 356.80 breaks as support, bearish momentum might swiftly drive the price down toward 350.87. Continued bearish presence could expose a further downside target of 346.64. Increased selling below this point would invite tests toward 340.97, and under intense bearish dominance, Tesla might revisit our deeper bearish target at 333.93.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday is poised to be highly event-driven, starting with the critical Core PCE Price Index for April, releasing at 8:30 AM ET. This will be complemented by Personal Income, Personal Spending, Advance Goods Trade Balance, and Preliminary Wholesale Inventories data also at 8:30 AM ET. Later in the morning at 9:45 AM ET, we will receive the Chicago PMI report for May, followed by the Final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment numbers and related Inflation Expectations at 10:00 AM ET. Additionally, commentary from Federal Reserve officials Bostic, Daly, and Goolsbee could further amplify market volatility.\n\nTraders should be particularly vigilant today, anticipating heightened volatility stemming from the convergence of these influential economic reports and month-end rebalancing flows. Given the expected increase in market swings, precise execution, disciplined risk management, and cautious decision-making will be essential. Stay attentive, trade strategically, and have a successful session.

    "data": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.\n\nTariff Invalidation\n\nPlease click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe chart shows a big move up in the early trade after the U.S. Court Of International Trade struck down tariffs imposed by President Trump under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nThe move up shown on the chart is due to investors doubling down on the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade.\n\nAlmost all of the buying shown on the chart is coming from the momo crowd, not from smart money.\n\nZone 1 (resistance) shown on the chart is the magnet for traders.\n\nAs a reader of our report, you are ahead of the curve. It is time to also get ahead of the TACO trade. In our analysis, President Trump has several alternatives. Investors who are counting President Trump out on tariffs and believing that President Trump will now completely back down are making a big mistake. To stay ahead of the curve, here are the key points you need to know: An injunction on tariffs is effective immediately, but the court has given the administration 10 days to implement it. Expect the administration to appeal to lift the injunction. If the appeal is not successful, expect President Trump to take the matter to the Supreme Court. The probability is high that the Supreme Court will rule in President Trump's favor. Using Section 122 of the Trade Act 1974, President Trump can impose tariffs up to 15% for up to 150 days. Such new tariffs can replace the existing 10% universal tariffs. Section 122 can be implemented quickly without any formalities. President Trump can use section 122 while an appeal is pending. President Trump can also use Section 338 to impose tariffs up to 50% on grounds that certain countries discriminate against the U.S. The court ruling leaves sectoral tariffs such as those on steel and aluminum in place. President Trump can simply use Section 232 to impose sectoral tariffs by expanding the list of sectors to almost every sector.\n\nThe reaction to NVIDIA Corp NVDA earnings is providing an important tell for investors. Nvidia reported earnings inline with the whisper numbers. Whisper numbers are the numbers analysts share privately only with their best clients. Whisper numbers are often different from the numbers analysts publish for public consumption. This is how analysts generate business. Whisper numbers had moved slightly higher than consensus numbers going into earnings. Stocks move based on the difference between whisper numbers and actual reported numbers. Since Nvidia reported inline with whisper numbers, based on historical patterns, NVDA stock should not have moved a lot. For our readers, the reaction to Nvidia earnings provides an important tell to get ahead of the curve. NVDA stock is up 5.38% as of this writing in the premarket, instead of only the 1-2% move that is warranted based on earnings. Buying is coming mostly from the momo crowd and not from smart money. The momo crowd is in the mode of buying everything that has news, good or bad. The momo crowd is aggressively buying because, right now, they are driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Prudent investors can get ahead of the curve by understanding that the foregoing behavior is a tell of extremely bullish sentiment. Remember that extremely bullish sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, it is a sell signal. It is worth repeating, sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.\n\nearnings is providing an important tell for investors. Initial jobless claims came at 240K vs. 230K consensus. This is an indication that employment may have begun weakening.\n\nGDP is a lagging indicator, but nonetheless important because the market pays attention to it. We focus on leading indicators in ten categories. Here are the details of the data: Q1 GDP Second Estimate came at -0.2% vs. -0.3% consensus. Q1 GDP Deflator Second Estimate came at 3.7% vs. 3.7% consensus.\n\n\n\nMass Layoffs Ahead Due To AI\n\nWe have previously shared with you that AI would bring mass layoffs. Now, the CEO of Antropic, a major large language model builder is echoing the same.\n\nHere are the key points you need to know:\n\nAI will write almost all software code within a year.\n\nThe impact on lower level white collar jobs will be devastating as such jobs will be automated. AI will be doing one half of today's entry level white collar jobs.\n\nUnemployment could rise to 20%.\n\nA vast majority of people who will be laid off are totally oblivious and have no idea what is about to hit them.\n\nIn our analysis, the AI impact on employment will have a major impact on the markets. Many investors will lose their shirts, but prudent investors who are ahead of the curve will have opportunities to make a fortune. This underscores the importance of staying ahead of the curve.\n\nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), Tesla Inc (TSLA), and NVDA.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).\n\nOil\n\nAPI crude inventories came at a draw of 4.236M barrels vs. a consensus of a build of 1M barrels. This data is bearish.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is range bound.\n\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is trading near the critical level of 593.73. Bulls will want early strength pushing toward 595.14. Sustained buying at this zone could propel the price to establish solid footing around 596.57. Holding this support could trigger an advance toward 598.04. Our upper bullish objective today is set at 599.24.\n\nIf the bulls falter at 593.73, bears will look to drive the market down to test support at 592.00. A decisive break beneath this level could encourage further selling toward 589.71. Persistent bearish pressure could bring the price even lower to the robust support at 587.31. Should heavy selling persist, the bearish target for today lies at 585.75.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is trading around the important mark of 527.03. Bulls need to see immediate support at this level and push upwards to secure 528.44 firmly. If buyers maintain momentum, the next upside hurdle at 530.70 becomes the focus. With continued strength, the auction may challenge 532.52, with a bullish extension target at 533.70.\n\nShould QQQ struggle to defend 527.03, sellers will likely dominate, pushing the price down toward the initial support at 525.19. Extended selling pressure could lead the bears to challenge lower support at 523.91. If sellers remain active, anticipate a retest of 522.57, and in a bearish scenario, the daily low target is at 521.15.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is hovering around the notable 205.54 area. Bulls will aim to push above and hold 206.55, providing a foundation to test the resistance at 207.18. Continued buying interest may lift the price towards 207.93, and sustained bullish activity could propel the market to today's upper bullish target of 208.81.\n\nIf 205.54 breaks down, selling activity may increase toward support at 204.33. Bears maintaining their strength could see Apple declining to 203.48. Continued selling pressure would put further downside pressure toward 202.29, with aggressive selling potentially driving Apple to today's bearish objective of 200.53.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is trading near the pivotal 460.78 level. Bulls seek a decisive hold above this area to extend gains toward 462.07. Securing this as a reliable support could encourage buying momentum, targeting an upside push to 463.27. Continued bullish momentum could drive the market higher, aiming at today\u2019s high bull objective of 464.70.\n\nIf buyers lose control at 460.78, expect the bears to aim lower towards 459.18. Breaking below this support would likely see intensified selling pressure pushing towards 457.25. Persistent bearish control might further weigh down the price to 455.77, with an extreme bearish target today set at 453.02.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nNVIDIA is trading around the crucial area of 142.35. Bulls will seek to reclaim and consolidate support at 144.21. Achieving this level could set the stage for further bullish movement towards 145.61. A strong buying presence might elevate the price to challenge 147.06, with the day\u2019s bullish peak target set at 148.52.\n\nIf the auction struggles to maintain support at 142.35, sellers may attempt to push the price toward the lower level of 141.21. Breaking this support could drive the price down to test 140.28. A continued weak market may see further declines toward 139.42, with sustained selling potentially reaching today\u2019s bearish target at 138.55.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is auctioning near the critical support at 174.01. Bulls must secure this level to strengthen buying sentiment towards 175.12. If buyers maintain their conviction, we anticipate a continued rally toward today\u2019s high bullish goal at 176.23.\n\nFailure to defend 174.01 would open the door for bears to push lower, initially targeting the support at 172.28. A sustained breach of this area may prompt further selling, testing the next downside level at 171.14. Strong selling pressures could drive Alphabet toward the daily bearish objective at 169.34.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is trading around the notable support of 650.56. Bulls will look to solidify this base and push the market upward toward 655.54. Maintaining strength above this zone could facilitate further bullish momentum, targeting an advance toward 658.86. A strong buying environment today may lift Meta to its upper bullish goal at 663.33.\n\nIf 650.56 gives way, bears could aggressively target the support at 646.48. Increased selling could intensify declines toward 642.59. Further bearish momentum could push the market down to test the daily bearish level set at 635.49.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is trading close to the critical price level of 363.84. Bulls will target a move upward toward the resistance at 370.22. Sustained bullish strength could propel the price towards 378.79, and further enthusiasm from buyers may encourage an extended push to test 384.07. Under ideal bullish conditions, Tesla could reach today\u2019s upper bullish target of 390.23.\n\nIf buyers are unable to hold 363.84 as support, sellers may drive prices downward to initially test 356.80. Further bearish action could pressure Tesla towards the next support at 350.87. Intense selling activity might then challenge 346.64, with the ultimate bearish target for today\u2019s session at 340.97.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nTraders will closely monitor several critical economic indicators and central bank speakers today. At 8:30 AM ET, we\u2019ll receive the second estimate of the US Q1 GDP alongside Personal Consumption, Initial Jobless Claims, and Continuing Claims. Pending Home Sales data will follow at 10:00 AM ET, with a significant 7-Year Treasury Note Auction scheduled for 1:00 PM ET. Markets will also react to comments from Fed officials Barkin (8:30 AM ET), Goolsbee (10:40 AM ET), Kugler (2:00 PM ET), and Daly (4:00 PM ET).\n\nGiven this packed economic schedule, expect notable volatility. Additional focus remains on developments regarding global trade disputes and tariffs, potentially amplifying market moves. Traders should remain nimble, adhere strictly to their risk management strategies, and avoid overextending positions. Best of luck, trade smart, and stay disciplined today!\n\nThe Morning Memo is curated by RIPS, a pro trader with years of experience in equities, options, and futures trading.

    "data": "The No. 1 position for the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) hasn't lost money on a rolling 20-year basis dating back more than a century.\n\nThere's nothing more important to investors than data -- and they're rarely, if ever, lacking for it on Wall Street. Between earnings reports, regular U.S. economic data releases, and Donald Trump's administration changing its tune on tariff and trade policy on a seemingly regular basis, there's always something for investors to dive into and learn.\n\nMay 15 marked one of these pivotal data releases for investors.\n\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors managing at least $100 million are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot for investors that allows them to see which stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and (select) options contracts Wall Street's most-prominent money managers have been buying and selling. It's a nice way to uncover which securities and trends are piquing the attention of big-money investors.\n\nBut there's a big world of investment dollars that extends beyond Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and select billionaire fund managers -- and it pays to know what these funds are holding.\n\nFor example, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, commonly known as CalPERS, manages north of $500 billion in assets on behalf of its more than 2 million members, which includes public employees, retirees, and their families. CalPERS spreads its investment capital across a broad swath of asset classes, including fixed income (e.g., Treasury bonds), private debt, private equity, and of course, public equities (stocks and ETFs).\n\nThough CalPERS closed the March-ended quarter with north of 1,100 securities in its portfolio, it's the top holding for America's largest pension fund that really stands out and delivers with long-term consistency.\n\nAmerica's largest pension fund owns pieces of many of America's most-influential businesses\n\nBased on CalPERS' 13F, its fund managers were overseeing approximately $143.1 billion in invested assets as of the end of March. With this being a highly diversified pension fund, only 14 of these positions equated to 1% or more of invested assets.\n\nBut what a majority of these leading positions have in common is that they're Wall Street's most-influential businesses. Excluding Saudi Aramco, which isn't traded on U.S. stock exchanges, eight of the 10 public companies to have reached a $1 trillion (or greater) valuation are among these 14 positions, with only Tesla and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing missing.\n\nFor instance, Apple (AAPL 1.79%) is the second-largest holding for CalPERS (5.4% of invested assets), based on its 13F. The roughly 34.66 million shares held equated to almost $7.7 billion in market value at the end of March. Though Apple's growth heyday might be in the rearview mirror, it's still a cash-generating machine thanks to its top-selling iPhone and its high-margin, subscription-driven services segment. Also, no public company has repurchased more of its own stock than Apple.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NVDA 1.26%), which briefly became the most-valuable public company by market cap, is CalPERS' No. 4 holding by market value (4.4% of invested assets). Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and Blackwell GPU architecture are primarily responsible for overseeing generative AI solutions and the training of large language models in high-compute data centers. By one estimate, AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030, and Nvidia is at the center of this growth trend.\n\nThe point being that many of CalPERS' biggest positions are tied to businesses that are instrumental to the ongoing success of the American and global economy.\n\nBut it's CalPERS' top holding that has an as-of-now perfect track record of delivering for long-term investors.\n\nCalPERS' top holding has (thus far) been a guaranteed moneymaker\n\nThough CalPERS' $143.1 billion portfolio is primarily comprised of individual stocks, the largest holding for America's top pension fund is an ETF: the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 1.08%) (7.9% of invested assets).\n\nThe beauty of ETFs is they can provide instant diversification or concentration, depending on your preference, with the click of a button. In this instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF attempts to mirror the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.03%).\n\nInstead of having to buy 503 separate securities -- three S&P 500 companies have two classes of shares, which is why there are currently 503 components and not an even 500 -- and weight them appropriately to effectively match the returns of the S&P 500, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF does this for investors with the click of the buy button.\n\nIn return for this ease of investment, investors pay various fees in the form of the net expense ratio. These fees cover the costs of overseeing the fund, marketing, and so on. Generally, the more active the turnover in the fund, the higher the net expense ratio.\n\nThe two biggest S&P 500 index funds by net assets are the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 1.06%). The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust was the first ETF to be listed on a national stock exchange.\n\nAlthough the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust effectively mirror the returns of the benchmark S&P 500, the two have one notable difference: their net expense ratios. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has a low net expense ratio of 0.09%. This means $0.90 of every $1,000 invested will be kept for various fees. Meanwhile, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a net expense ratio of just 0.03%. While six hundredths of a percent might not sound like much, it can add up over multiple decades as your investment grows.\n\nBut what really makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF special is its, thus far, guaranteed long-term returns.\n\nTo preface, nothing is concretely a given when it comes to the stock market. Neither I nor any analyst can tell you with 100% certainty what comes next for stocks. But S&P 500 tracking indexes like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF are the closest thing to an investment guarantee on Wall Street.\n\nEvery year, the analysts at Crestmont Research update a data set that examines the rolling 20-year total returns, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 dating back to the start of the 20th century. Even though the S&P wasn't officially incepted until 1923, researchers were able to track the performance of its components in other major indexes from 1900 to 1923 to obtain the relevant total return data. This resulted in 106 rolling 20-year periods to examine (1900-1919, 1901-1920, 1902-1921, and so on, to 2005-2024).\n\nWhat Crestmont Research found was that all 106 rolling 20-year periods produced a positive annualized return. Hypothetically, if you had purchased an S&P 500 tracking index at any point between 1900 and 2005 and simply held for 20 years, you made money every time. It didn't matter if you purchased at the top of a bull market, held through a recession or depression, or navigated through a war or pandemic -- you would have grown your wealth every time.\n\nArguably no stock market investment has delivered with more long-term consistency than S&P 500 index funds \u2013 and no S&P 500 ETF has a more favorable net expense ratio than the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF."

Only 8% of viewers predict a double miss, with both figures missing analyst estimates.\n\nTwenty-four percent of viewers see a mixed result, with 20% predicting a revenue beat and EPS miss and 4% predicting an EPS beat and revenue miss.\n\nSplit by reporting figures, 85% of viewers said Nvidia will beat revenue estimates; 69% said that Nvidia will beat EPS estimates.\n\nNvidia has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in 10 straight quarters and analyst estimates for earnings per share in nine straight quarters.\n\nRead Also: NVIDIA Q1 Earnings Preview: Analyst Cautions On Macro Uncertainty, China Restrictions \u2013 \u2018Stay Long The Stock\u2019\n\nPast Poll Results: The results of the Nvidia poll and prediction of a double beat by the majority of viewers come after polls for viewers of the same morning show produced correct predictions for other Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nIn April, Benzinga readers correctly predicted that Tesla Inc TSLA would miss analyst estimates in the first quarter.\n\nA poll found 68% of viewers predicting a miss, 19% predicting a beat and 11% predicting in-line figures. Tesla missed both revenue and earnings per share estimates from analysts in the quarter.\n\nViewers of \"PreMarket Playbook\" also predicted Apple Inc AAPL would beat estimates in the second quarter. The poll was closer, with 30% predicting a beat, 27% predicting mixed results, 26% predicting a miss, and 15% not sure.\n\nApple narrowly beat earnings per share estimates from analysts and beat revenue estimates for the second quarter.\n\nTime will tell if Benzinga viewers are once again correct and Nvidia posts a double-beat Wednesday after the market closes.\n\nNVDA Price Action: Nvidia stock is down 0.2% to $135.19 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $86.62 to $153.12. It is down 2.3% year-to-date in 2025.\n\nLoading...

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is presently trading near our pivotal area of 589.71. Bullish traders aim to lift prices first towards 592.00. If bulls successfully secure this level, the upward momentum may carry price action toward the next resistance zone at 593.73. A sustained bullish stance here during the cash session would open the pathway towards 595.14. The maximum bullish expectation today sits at the 596.57 mark.\n\nOn the downside, if bulls lose control at 589.71, bearish pressure would likely intensify towards the lower test at 587.31. Persistent selling here could further push prices downward to challenge the critical support at 585.75. Should heavy selling materialize below this support, anticipate a deeper pullback towards our bear target for today at 583.18.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is trading near the crucial area at 522.57. Bullish conviction must materialize above this pivot to secure bullish footing and propel the market higher toward 523.91. Successful defense here could ignite an upward drive towards the subsequent resistance at 525.19. If bullish sentiment remains robust, anticipate further upward continuation targeting 527.03, with today\u2019s top bullish goal set at 528.44.\n\nShould the buyers falter around 522.57, look for sellers to seize control, driving prices down to the support at 521.15. Persistent bearish energy here could lead the auction lower towards 519.87. Continued bearish momentum would open the door for a test of the deeper support at 518.65. Failing this support, expect sellers to target our low-end bearish objective at 517.97.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple's current trading hovers around our notable support at 200.53. Bullish traders will strive to maintain upward momentum above 202.29, aiming to rally towards 203.48. Sustained bullish sentiment at this zone may extend Apple\u2019s rally further towards 204.33. A decisive bullish push higher today would ideally test our ultimate bullish level for Apple at 205.54.\n\nConversely, failing to maintain the initial support at 200.53 could trigger a bearish move towards the immediate lower boundary of 199.51. Should selling activity persist here, anticipate further downside exploration to 198.79. Continued selling pressure might accelerate declines to test 198.22. If this area fails under bearish conditions, expect Apple to target the lower bearish level at 197.69.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft currently trades around our highlighted area at 460.78. Bulls are aiming to firmly defend this support and drive prices upward towards 462.07, establishing solid footing. Strong bullish consolidation here could trigger further upside action, initially targeting 463.27. Continued bullish advancement might propel prices toward today\u2019s high bullish objective at 464.70.\n\nShould Microsoft fail to hold onto 460.78, expect bearish traders to actively pursue a downward test at 459.18. If weakness prevails at this point, sellers will likely target a deeper move to 457.25. Further bearish momentum could expose prices to additional downside risk, reaching 455.77. Persistent bearishness today could ultimately lead the market to our final bearish level of 453.02.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nNVIDIA currently auctions near our notable level of 136.98. Bulls seek an immediate bullish push towards 137.94, where solidifying support would suggest further bullish potential. Continued buyer conviction could fuel a move upward to 138.55. Sustained bullish aggression today would likely test the resistance around 139.42, with the day\u2019s highest bullish objective marked at 140.28.\n\nShould buyers fail to hold the line at 136.98, anticipate bearish momentum driving prices lower towards initial support at 135.64. Breaking down here on strong selling volume would open further declines to 134.56. A prolonged bearish scenario would likely expose additional downside to 133.31. If bearish strength continues unabated, we anticipate testing today\u2019s ultimate bear target at 132.19.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently trading around our significant area at 174.01. Bulls will aim to establish firm support here, initially seeking an advance to 175.12. Sustained bullish strength could facilitate further price exploration upwards, targeting today\u2019s prime bullish objective at 176.23.\n\nOn the downside, if 174.01 fails as solid support, bearish traders will likely push prices aggressively lower towards 172.28. Continued bearish dominance would trigger further selling towards 171.14. If the bearish sentiment amplifies, anticipate additional downside exploration towards our final bearish target today at 169.34.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is trading near our notable pivot point at 642.59. The bulls are expected to defend this position vigorously and drive upward momentum initially toward 646.48. Strong buying interest could further propel Meta towards the 650.56 area. A decisive and sustained bullish effort today would aim to push Meta up towards our peak bullish goal of 655.54.\n\nConversely, failure to hold support at 642.59 will likely prompt bearish traders to push lower aggressively towards 635.49. Continued bearish pressure could accelerate declines to 629.88. Breaking below this area decisively would likely encourage additional bearish momentum, aiming for today\u2019s ultimate bearish target at 622.01.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla currently trades near our critical price zone at 363.84. Bulls are eager to drive prices higher to initially test the 370.22 resistance. A firm bullish presence here could fuel continued upward action towards the next significant resistance at 378.79. If bullish sentiment accelerates in today\u2019s trading session, Tesla might extend its rally to the elevated target of 384.07, with today\u2019s maximum bullish projection set at 390.23.\n\nIf 363.84 fails to hold as significant support today, bearish traders will likely push prices lower towards initial support at 356.80. Continued bearish pressure may drive prices further down towards 350.87. Should bearish selling intensify, anticipate further downside risk targeting support at 346.64. Persistent selling pressure could lead Tesla down toward our final bearish price target today at 340.97.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nThe economic docket today appears modest, but it contains key indicators that could ignite notable volatility. At 10AM ET, traders will monitor the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index release for May, offering insights into the region\u2019s industrial sector. Following this, at 10:30AM ET, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity will offer another gauge of economic health, potentially influencing intraday sentiment.

    "data": "Nvidia Corporation NVDA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s rejection of PowerPoint presentations isn't a quirky habit\u2014it's part of a broader trend among some of the most successful tech leaders who believe slide decks are a barrier to real thinking.\n\nWhat Happened: In \"The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant,\" a book published last year detailing Nvidia's rise, one of the most striking revelations is Huang's near-total ban on PowerPoint, according to DigiTimes Asia, a Taiwanese media outlet.\n\nInstead, Huang prefers whiteboard meetings, which he believes foster sharper, more transparent conversations.\n\nAs per the book, Huang's team ensures a whiteboard is always available, whether in the office or while traveling. A former Nvidia executive even recalled an instance where the requested board was so large it required five people to bring it into a conference room.\n\nSee Also: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Says Losing Access To China\u2019s Potential $50 Billion AI Market Would Be A \u2018Tremendous Loss\u2019\n\nAt Nvidia headquarters, many conference rooms feature entire whiteboard walls. Huang believes whiteboards prevent employees from hiding behind flashy formatting and force them to engage in live problem-solving, the report noted, citing the book.\n\nAnd he's not alone in this view.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL co-founder Steve Jobs once said, \"People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint.\" He insisted that real conversations\u2014not slide decks\u2014drive decisions, reported Inc.com.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. AMZN founder Jeff Bezos also replaced slide decks with written memos. \"The narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought,\" he explained.\n\nAttendees in Bezos-led meetings begin by silently reading a multi-page memo before discussing it, allowing for deeper reflection and structured conversation.\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has also previously advised leaders to \"get out of PowerPoint and just start building.\" LinkedIn's Jeff Weiner also eliminated presentations, saying, \"The meeting can now be exclusively focused on generating a valuable discourse.\"\n\nMicrosoft Corporation's MSFT former CEO Steve Ballmer also found slide presentations inefficient. \"You take the listener through your path of discovery\u2026 I decided that's not what I want to do anymore,\" he said.\n\nTesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk has also echoed these sentiments during a 2020 interview with the Wall Street Journal, criticizing CEOs who spend too much time on PowerPoint and not enough on product innovation.\n\n\"Spend less time in conference rooms, less time on PowerPoint and more time just trying to make your product as amazing as possible,\" Musk stated then.\n\nIt is important to note that these CEOs are likely referring broadly to slide presentations, regardless of the specific software used to create them.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: jamesonwu1972 on Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nLoading...

    "data": "Tesla has lofty ambitions when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), but the technology isn't transforming the company just yet.\n\nWhen it comes to the biggest companies developing artificial intelligence (AI), it's hard not to think about the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- that is, Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 3.85%).\n\nTo a degree, however, Tesla is somewhat of an outlier in this cohort. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have already benefited immensely from AI adoption, particularly across cloud computing infrastructure. Apple and Meta are both working hard to integrate AI services into their devices and platforms. And of course, Nvidia's GPUs are a key piece of the hardware powering generative AI applications across the globe.\n\nBut what about Tesla? Sure, the company develops autonomous driving software and has its sights on building a ride-hailing fleet, called the Robotaxi. But in my opinion, the AI thesis surrounding Tesla is currently more of a narrative than concrete reality.\n\nAlthough this may cause some investors to remain skeptical of Tesla and its ambitions, the company's eccentric chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has received a major nod of validation from none other than Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia.\n\nLet's explore why Huang is so impressed by Musk, and detail what could be in store at the intersection of Tesla and AI down the road.\n\nJensen Huang's praise for Elon Musk should not go unnoticed\n\nMusk manages a lot of other businesses beyond Tesla. In recent years, one of Musk's newer projects is a start-up called xAI.\n\nxAI built a supercomputer called Colossus, which runs on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's GPU chipsets and is planning on deploying more. While I'm sure Musk's decision to use Nvidia's chips earned him some brownie points with Huang, that's not why the Nvidia CEO praised what xAI is building.\n\nRather, it's how xAI got Colossus up and running that caught Huang's attention.\n\nDuring an interview with venture capitalist Brad Gerstner, Huang said that designing and planning the infrastructure needed to build Colossus could take roughly three years, and then actually take another year to build the supercomputer.\n\nMusk and the xAI team built Colossus and had it running in 19 days! When singing his praise for Musk, Huang said that what xAI has done is \"singular.\"\n\nWhy is xAI's supercomputer important for Tesla?\n\nAs I alluded to in the introduction, one of Tesla's main AI ambitions is building a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.\n\nRight now, Tesla trains its models for developing self-driving car software through a custom supercomputer called Dojo. While Dojo's capabilities are impressive, I think there is a unique opportunity for Musk to integrate xAI with Tesla's ecosystem.\n\nFor example, when it comes to autonomous driving, Tesla's problem isn't collecting enough data. The company already has nearly 3.5 billion miles worth of data that's been captured.\n\nHowever, in order to scale its fleet and truly disrupt the ride-hailing market, Tesla also needs to be able to process data at faster speeds -- this is where Colossus could lend a hand. By augmenting the Dojo system with Colossus, I think Tesla could rapidly increase the pace at which the company trains its neural network needed to perfect the full self-driving (FSD) system.\n\nBy vertically integrating xAI with Tesla, Musk can build a lucrative flywheel between his AI enterprises. Tesla vehicles will continue capturing data from drivers, which xAI then uses to train FSD models faster, allowing Tesla to deploy these improved models back into its fleet -- ultimately strengthening the robotaxi network.\n\nComplementing xAI with Tesla also brings a subtle cost-saving opportunity in the form of reduced capital expenditures (capex). By leveraging xAI, Tesla can achieve synergies across data compute and product integration costs -- thus providing the company with more financial flexibility and allowing it to rely less on external hardware vendors over time.\n\nIs Tesla stock a buy right now?\n\nAlthough the ideas explored in this piece might make you more encouraged about Tesla's AI ambitions, I must admit that, for now, these concepts are also just narratives as opposed to tangible opportunities.\n\nNevertheless, recent price action suggests that investors are getting excited for Tesla's foray into the robotaxi market next month.\n\nA 50% rise in the share price in just one month makes me think a lot of the upside from the company's AI efforts is already priced into the stock.\n\nWhile I'm optimistic about Tesla's future, I wouldn't chase momentum at these levels."

    "data": "Benzinga examined the prospects for many investors' favorite stocks over the last week \u2014 here's a look at some of our top stories.\n\nU.S. markets experienced heightened volatility this week as President Donald Trump intensified trade tensions by threatening a 25% tariff on foreign-made Apple AAPL products and announcing a 50% tariff on European Union imports starting June 1. These announcements led to a decline in major indices, with the S&P 500 falling 0.7%, the Dow Jones dropping 0.6%, and the Nasdaq decreasing by 1%. Apple shares were particularly affected, losing 3% in value.\n\nInvestor concerns over the U.S. fiscal outlook grew as the 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5.15%, reflecting apprehensions about rising deficits and debt sustainability. A weak 20-year Treasury auction further exacerbated these fears, indicating diminished demand for long-term U.S. debt.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are closely monitoring upcoming U.S.-China trade negotiations and potential adjustments to existing tariffs. The Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates remains a focal point, especially as real borrowing costs rise, tightening broader financial conditions. Additionally, corporate earnings reports and economic indicators will continue to influence market dynamics in the coming weeks.\n\nBenzinga provides daily reports on the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look.\n\nThe Bulls\n\n\"Google: Could smart glasses, speech spark the stock's next big leap?\", by Surbhi Jain, reports that Alphabet Inc. GOOGL is gaining investor attention as its partnership with Warby Parker to develop AI-powered smart glasses and advancements in speech recognition technology signal a potential new growth narrative beyond search.\n\n\"Goldman Sachs: Golden Dome is big win for this defense stock\", by Piero Cingari, reports that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS analyst Noah Poponak reiterated a Buy rating on L3Harris Technologies Inc.

    "data": "Just as Wall Street seemed as though a sense of stability was finally seeping into 2025, President Trump served a timely reminder that tariff uncertainty will continue to drive market volatility.\n\nThe President announced that he would be \"recommending\" sweeping 50% tariffs on all European Union imports, due to start on June 1, as a result of a perceived lack of progress in trade negotiations with the bloc.\n\nTrump elaborated that factors like the EU's trade barriers, VAT taxes, corporate penalties, non-monetary trade barriers, and lawsuits against US firms had contributed to an annual trade deficit exceeding $250 billion, which was labeled \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\nEuropean benchmarks bore the brunt of the President's tariff threat, with the Euro STOXX 50 index tumbling 3% while Italy's FTSE MIB was the worst-affected national index, falling 2.9%.\n\nHowever, all eyes are now on the S&P 500 and how US markets will respond, just a matter of weeks after the US and China's escalating trade war briefly sank the index before a climbdown restored a measure of investor confidence.\n\nThe shock of the announcement triggered a 1.62% decline in the index while investors struggled with the severity of the President's threats.\n\nWorryingly for the tech-heavy S&P 500, Trump also took aim at Apple by suggesting that iPhones should be manufactured in the United States or else the product will be subject to a 25% tariff.\n\nAt a time when markets have been recovering following the announcement of a 90-day delay to the United States' reciprocal tariffs announced in April, as well as a subsequent delay to the escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump's hard stance on the European Union and tech imports serves as a timely reminder that Wall Street needs to become accustomed to tariff uncertainty in 2025.\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nAn Index in Flux\n\nForecasts for the S&P 500 have changed dramatically throughout different stages of the year. Despite trading more than 15% lower between January 1 and April 8, 2025, the index briefly turned positive for the year in mid-May before losing momentum once again.\n\nJust hours before Trump's announcements, Capital Economics raised its forecast for the S&P 500 to 7,000 by the end of 2026, citing the easing of trade tensions and improved market conditions as a core reason for the upturn in confidence.\n\nThis positive sentiment was echoed by Sonu Varghese, a global macro strategist with Carson Wealth, who suggested that there was \u2018too much uncertainty,' but that the Trump administration's recent pullbacks from their initial tariff salvo were a cause for cautious optimism.\n\nThis turnaround in sentiment has been astonishing when looking back at April's tariff-related downturn. In the midst of Trump's tariff uncertainty, the Economy Forecast Agency updated its expectations for the S&P 500 to an annual close of 4,379. Looking further ahead to the end of 2026, expectations appeared a little rosier at 5,708.\n\nThese major expectation shifts from economists show that Wall Street is struggling to keep up with the unpredictability of the Trump administration and that the S&P 500 is likely to be more vulnerable to unexpected investor sentiment changes based on the President's use of social media to share frequent policy updates.\n\nDisrupting the Magnificent Seven\n\nIt would be a challenge to assess which of Trump's announcements \u2013 on EU tariffs and levies on Apple product imports \u2013 has the most significant ramifications for the S&P 500.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven, a collective of large-cap tech stocks consisting of Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla, accounts for more than one-third of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. This means that tariff disruption affecting these stocks can severely impact the performance of the index as a whole.\n\nUpon claiming that Apple AAPL would be subject to a 25% import tariff if iPhones continue to be manufactured outside of the United States, the tech giant's stock slipped 3.72% at the beginning of trading on Friday, 23 May.\n\nApple had been resorting to airlifting as much as 600 tons of iPhones from India as a means of bypassing tariffs. However, Trump's ambitions for American firms are to shift manufacturing to the United States, helping to boost industry.\n\nShould the President adopt a similar stance to US tech leaders and large-cap firms, we could see severe disruption throughout many key market players and their supply chains.\n\nGiven that manufacturing in China, for instance, is significantly lower in cost compared to the United States due to factors like cheaper labour, smaller energy costs, and stronger logistics, the shift to US-based manufacturing could be a significant disruptive force should domestic infrastructure struggle to keep up.\n\nAdapting to Uncertainty\n\n2025 is fast becoming a year of extreme market uncertainty due to the unpredictability of tariffs and the willingness of the President to share prospective policy shifts on social media.\n\nFor investors, it's essential to keep a level head when dealing with volatility in the S&P 500 and to avoid taking rash decisions by withdrawing investments or buying into speculative stocks on a whim.\n\nWe're likely to learn a lot about Trump's stance on tariffs as the initial 90-day tariff delay to April's reciprocal tariffs ends on July 8. Until then, adopting a more cautious strategy could be the most measured strategy on Wall Street.\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently holding around the 580.67 level. If buyers step in early, the next upside pivot to watch is 581.97. A firm push above that may attract momentum traders aiming to lift the tape toward 583.18. Should this level stabilize as support, it could trigger a further advance to 584.68. The most optimistic bull target on the day is 585.75, contingent on consistent strength and volume.\n\nIf 580.67 fails to attract buyers, the bears may press toward 579.12 as their first target. Weakness beneath that opens the door for a slide to 577.87. Should pressure continue, the key support zone at 576.62 comes into play. If the session trends strongly to the downside, our final bear target rests at 575.67.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is currently orbiting the 511.53 zone. If bulls can establish control above 513.64, look for a move into 515.00 as the next level of interest. Strength through that area suggests 516.58 is in reach, with an extension to 517.97 on elevated buy-side flow. Our highest upside target for the day is 518.65, should the broader market cooperate.\n\nIf 511.53 is lost during the session, sellers are likely to test support at 509.87. A sustained break there invites further downside action toward 508.22. Continued pressure could then bring the tape down to 506.68. If bears dominate, 504.44 becomes the key target to end the day.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is hovering near 194.83 as we begin the session. A strong early move through 195.67 could ignite interest and send price to test 196.01. If bulls retain control, the next level in focus is 197.00. The bullish roadmap for today points to a potential peak at 198.22 if momentum persists.\n\nFailure to hold 194.83 sets the stage for a slide toward 194.40. If selling escalates from there, we could see price tag 193.95. Breaking through this zone with continued volume opens the door to 193.18, with 191.57 sitting as the final bear target on heavy weakness.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is actively trading around 453.02. Bulls want to build a base here and advance toward 455.77. Holding that level as support could provide the fuel needed to climb to 457.25. Should buyers stay engaged, 459.18 is the level to beat for the session's bullish top.\n\nIf 453.02 gives way to downside momentum, the bears may challenge 450.26. Cracking that level exposes 448.18, and persistent selling could continue dragging MSFT to 446.33. If sellers remain in charge through the afternoon, our downside goal stands at 444.95.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is floating near the 133.31 mark to start the day. Bulls will be watching for a push to 134.56 and to see this area flip into firm support. A clear hold above that could encourage a move toward 135.64, and continued upside enthusiasm may bring 136.98 into view. The bullish ceiling on the day sits at 137.94.\n\nIf NVIDIA breaks down from 133.31, 132.19 becomes the first test. Further weakness could drag the tape to 131.42. If that level caves, look for a move down to 129.53. Heavy downside pressure today could push the stock to its session low target of 128.10.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently balanced around the 171.14 level. Bulls want to see a lift toward 172.28 and for that level to serve as a springboard higher. Should that materialize, look for the rally to extend into 174.01. Momentum continuation could drive GOOGL toward the bullish peak at 175.12.\n\nIf 171.14 collapses under pressure, sellers are likely to move swiftly toward 169.34. A breach of that may result in further declines to 167.04. If the bears remain active and news sentiment turns sour, a flush to 165.41 is on the table.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is consolidating around the 635.49 mark. Bulls are targeting 642.59 on the upside as the next logical step if strength develops. A follow-through from there brings 646.48 into focus. Should bullish sentiment stay intact, 650.56 is our high watermark for the session.\n\nShould 635.49 break early, expect downside probes toward 629.88. If sellers stay aggressive, the auction may revisit 622.01. A break below this support zone puts 615.65 within reach for today's bear target.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is trading near the 340.64 zone this morning. Buyers are eyeing 350.87 as their next milestone, followed by a potential stretch up to 356.80. If bullish energy carries over, Tesla could move swiftly to 363.84. With a strong tailwind from the broader tape, a print at 370.22 isn't off the table.\n\nIf 340.64 gives up, 333.93 is likely to be challenged. A move through that level could bring sellers down to 322.52. Sustained weakness may carry Tesla to a low of 327.59 before finding real support.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nWith a thin calendar today, traders should prepare for slower tape action and lighter liquidity. April's New Home Sales hit at 10AM ET, followed by the Kansas City Fed Services Activity at 11AM ET. Beyond that, the early bond market close at 2PM ET ahead of the long weekend adds another layer of potential chop and reduced participation.\n\nBe cautious pressing trades into low volume and headline-driven moves. Focus on execution over prediction and tighten risk if activity stalls. It's the kind of session where patience often pays more than aggression. Enjoy your Friday, manage your edge, and have a relaxing Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe Morning Memo is curated by RIPS, a pro trader with years of experience in equities, options, and futures trading.

    "data": "Chinese carmaker BYD Company ADR BYDDY might have stolen the April electric vehicle title in Europe, but markets didn\u2019t bat an eyelid. Neither did Tesla TSLA shares.\n\nBYD sold 7,231 battery electric cars (BEVs) in Europe in April, edging out Tesla, which sold 7,165, new figures from JATO Dynamics show. Although the milestone represents a symbolic turning point in the European EV battle, it didn\u2019t dent investor faith, as Tesla shares gained more than 2% on the day of the news.\n\nIt's the first time a Chinese brand has outsold Tesla in Europe's BEV segment, a region where the U.S. automaker has long held the pole position. BYD's ascent has been swift: the company began serious expansion into Europe only in late 2022.\n\nBut markets appear to be betting that it\u2019s only short-term turbulence for Tesla.\n\nETF Exposure: Why Tesla Still Matters\n\nTesla\u2019s short fall in European rankings will be a speed bump, but for ETFs tracking the EV and clean energy theme, the larger picture still seems intact.\n\nTesla is still a top holding in many of the large ETFs, like the ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF DRIV, and iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF IDRV, and today\u2019s market response indicates that few are heading for the exits.\n\nARKK continues to hold a significant stake in Tesla (12.95%), relying on its push into autonomous mobility, artificial intelligence, and robotics. The upcoming robotaxi pilot and production of the Cybercab next year are part of ARKK's high-conviction, future-focused strategy. For investors betting on transformative tech, Tesla is still a solid play. The fund was up 1.42% at publication on Thursday.\n\nETFs like DRIV and IDRV has a wider exposure across the EV supply chain, including traditional automakers, chipmakers and software providers. Tesla is still one of the top holdings in both, but these funds also include companies like NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Toyota Motor Corp. TM, and Apple Inc AAPL, which help cushion any Tesla-specific volatility.\n\nThis diversified approach makes it attractive to investors looking to benefit from the EV trend without putting all their chips on one automaker. Interestingly, though, IDRIV has rejigged its portfolio to dedicate the largest percentage distribution to BYD. Both the funds were fairly non-reactive to the news today.\n\nAlso Read: Tesla Bull Dan Ives Thinks Elon Musk\u2019s EV Giant Could Be Entering A \u2018Golden Era,\u2019 Says 2 Trillion Market Cap \u2018On The Table\u2019\n\nShort-Term Wobble, Long-Term Vision\n\nTesla\u2019s recent delivery downturn, continuing production interruptions and waiting for updated models such as the new Model Y have caused short-term headwinds.\n\nThe stock is down more than 9% so far this year on an aggregate. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s long-term strategy, backed by robotaxis, AI-based innovations, energy storage and next-generation vehicle platforms, is still compelling. Tesla\u2019s pilot robotaxi launch will start as early as June in Austin, while a larger commercial fleet (Cybercab) is scheduled for 2026.\n\nFor ETFs such as ARKK, which are constructed on narratives of innovation, Tesla still fits the thesis.\n\nBYD\u2019s Rise = A Diversification Opportunity\n\nBYD\u2019s increasing foothold in Europe, despite the tariffs on Chinese manufacturers imposed by the European Union, underscores the need for geographic diversification across EV ETFs. Funds like KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility ETF KARS, which encompass both Western and Chinese carmakers, are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the worldwide nature of EV growth. BYD is also growing rapidly, doubling international sales in April on a year-over-year basis, and establishing manufacturing platforms in Hungary and Turkey to circumvent EU import tariffs.\n\nESG Considerations And Musk\u2019s Shadow\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, remains a magnet for attention, some of it unwanted. Protests and controversy surrounding his politics have generated backlash in the U.S. and Europe, creating an overhang for ESG-oriented funds. Nevertheless, for most ETFs, the firm\u2019s role in electrification and renewable energy exceeds the reputation risk, at least in the short term.\n\nRoom To Grow\n\nTesla\u2019s affordability, volume expansion, and capital-free manufacturing focus is unbroken. The firm is targeting lower-cost models and expanding production with minimal incremental capital, aiming for a 60% uplift ratio over 2024 levels. Its energy segment is also picking up, with record Powerwall installations and expanding margins.\n\nConclusion\n\nBYD\u2019s passing of Tesla in Europe\u2019s EV rankings is news-worthy, but not necessarily the turning point. ETF investors and the broader market seem to be seeing through the noise and concentrating on fundamentals. Tesla might be facing choppy waters today, but it remains an ETF pick and is at the center of the future of mobility and innovation.\n\nAs the EV industry continues to grow, ETFs that accept Tesla\u2019s long-term vision along with the emergence of legitimate challengers such as BYD might be the most balanced way to go.\n\nLoading...

Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently trading near our pivot at 589.71. Bulls should initially aim for a move upward toward 592.00. Sustained buying pressure above this zone could lift prices to a crucial resistance at 595.14. If this level proves resilient during today\u2019s session, buyers might successfully drive SPY higher, targeting the 596.57 area, with a potential upside reach to our ultimate bullish objective at 598.04.\n\nIf SPY struggles and loses support at 589.71, bearish momentum will likely accelerate toward testing 587.31. If selling intensifies and this level breaks decisively, anticipate further downside momentum to the support area at 585.75.

Bulls ideally want a clear move and a stable hold above 518.65, establishing firm support before advancing to the 519.87 zone. A sustained bullish presence could lift prices toward 521.15. If bullish momentum persists, anticipate price action extending upward toward 522.57, with our bullish target topping out today at 523.91.\n\nHowever, if the auction shows signs of weakness at 517.97, bears will likely seize control and attempt a downward thrust toward 516.58. If selling pressure continues, expect a further decline targeting the 515.00 region. Persistent bearish action may push QQQ to challenge critical support at 513.64, with intense selling potentially driving prices down to our low bear target of 511.53.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is auctioning around the pivotal mark of 206.55. Bulls should initially focus on claiming and holding support above 207.18. Strength above this level would encourage an advance toward 207.93. Continued bullish momentum can extend the rally to the 208.81 area, and if buyers maintain firm control, our high bull objective today rests at 209.81.\n\nConversely, if support at 206.55 fails, sellers could swiftly press Apple downward toward the next key level at 205.54. Ongoing bearish momentum could further pressure prices toward 204.33. A breach of this level under heavy selling might expose a deeper decline to 203.48, potentially reaching our bearish target at 202.29 if downside momentum persists.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is trading near our pivotal point at 455.77. For bullish conviction, traders will aim to establish strength above 457.25, enabling an extension toward the next resistance at 459.18. Should this level provide reliable support during today\u2019s session, we anticipate a rally toward the next target at 460.78. Sustained bullish strength may propel Microsoft to test our bullish ceiling today at 462.07.\n\nIf Microsoft weakens below the support of 455.77, expect sellers to quickly push toward 453.02. Further downside pressure below this level may lead to a test of support at 450.26. Persistent bearish activity might expose deeper price erosion toward 448.18, and if bearish dominance intensifies, we may see our bearish target reached at 446.33.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is currently trading near our critical level at 133.31. Bulls should look to reclaim and sustain prices above 134.56, establishing firm bullish sentiment before pushing further toward 135.64. A continuation of buying could spark an advance toward the key resistance at 136.98, with strong bullish momentum potentially driving prices to our ultimate bullish target of 137.94.\n\nOn the downside, failure to maintain 133.31 as support may lead bears to initiate selling toward 132.19. Continued downside momentum might further pressure NVIDIA toward 131.42. If bearish sentiment intensifies, anticipate prices to test support at 129.53, potentially extending lower toward our bearish target today at 128.10.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is auctioning around our key pivot at 165.41. Bulls need to successfully claim and maintain 166.12 as solid support, paving the way toward a bullish move to 167.04. If bullish energy remains strong, the auction could rally further to our bullish peak for today at 169.34.\n\nIf 165.41 fails as support, expect sellers to quickly press Alphabet downward to 163.79. Persistent selling could intensify the bearish momentum, pressing prices toward the 161.79 level. Under continued bearish pressure, Alphabet might descend further, ultimately targeting our low bear level at 160.36.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is trading near the significant pivot at 635.49. Bulls should initially establish strength above this point, aiming to rally prices upward toward 642.59. Sustained bullish momentum could lead to further gains, targeting the 646.48 level. Continued buying strength may lift Meta to reach our bullish high point today at 650.56.\n\nIf the 635.49 area fails to act as reliable support, bears will likely initiate a push downward toward 629.88. Persistent selling may intensify downward pressure, aiming at a deeper test of 622.01. If bearish activity remains forceful, prices might further descend to our lowest bearish level today at 615.65.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is auctioning near our focal point at 346.64. Buyers ideally need strength above this level, targeting the initial resistance at 350.87. Continuation of bullish sentiment may drive prices upward to challenge the pivotal area at 356.80. A broadly bullish market scenario could see Tesla pushing higher toward 363.84, and exceptional bullish momentum may see our bullish peak today at 370.22.\n\nOn the bearish side, failing to maintain support at 346.64 may invite downward pressure targeting the support at 340.97. Continued selling could drive prices lower, bringing 333.93 into focus. Should bearish pressure remain intense, anticipate Tesla to drop toward the critical support at 327.59, potentially reaching our bearish extreme at 322.52.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday's economic schedule is notably sparse, with the main highlight being the 20-Year Treasury Bond Auction at 1 PM ET. Additionally, we will hear remarks from Federal Reserve non-voting member Thomas Barkin at 12 PM ET, which traders will monitor for potential insights into Fed perspectives. Due to limited scheduled catalysts, market participants should remain vigilant to unexpected news headlines, geopolitical developments, or unscheduled events that could rapidly impact sentiment and market dynamics.\n\nGiven this backdrop, traders are advised to prioritize disciplined risk management, exercise patience, and remain adaptable to shifting market conditions.

    "data": "Building a stock portfolio from scratch can be a challenge. There are thousands of stocks to choose from, and most of them won't outperform the major stock market indexes. However, by choosing a diversified set of stocks with solid fundamentals, savvy investors can build a portfolio that not only survives but thrives.\n\nBelow, I'll discuss how I would construct a hypothetical portfolio today if I had $50,000 to invest.\n\nVisa\n\nTo get things started, I'm turning to Visa (V 1.00%). The company's business model is one of my favorites within the entire stock market because of its simplicity and asset-light nature. Moreover, it benefits from an enormous network effect that keeps growing stronger every year.\n\nVisa partners with card-issuing institutions (e.g., banks and credit unions). Those institutions provide debit and credit cards to their members, and the cards are used to perform transactions across Visa's payment network. In exchange for access to the payment network, the company collects fees on each transaction, which is how it generates the bulk of its $37 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAll told, it processes around 234 billion transactions per year with a staggering value of $16 trillion. For comparison, that value of transactions is roughly equal to the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of either China or the European Union.\n\nFor my hypothetical portfolio, I'll allocate $20,000, or 40%, to this stalwart of the financial industry.\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nThe online brokerage industry is nothing new. Investors have been able to place orders and track investments there for at least 30 years now.\n\nHowever, Robinhood (HOOD 3.27%) is by far the fastest-growing major brokerage firm. According to research by The Motley Fool, Robinhood ranks ninth in assets under management (AUM), with around $100 billion, as of the end of 2023.\n\nIt easily takes first place when it comes to the speed at which it's growing its AUM. As of the end of 2023, its AUM growth rate stood at 96%, blowing away its next closest competitor, Ally Financial, with 47% growth.\n\nMuch of this is due to Robinhood's popularity among younger investors, who are drawn to the company's focus on crypto, futures, and live-event trading. Moreover, the company looks well placed to benefit from the Great Wealth Transfer, as trillions of dollars in investment-related accounts pass from baby boomers to their heirs.\n\nFor my hypothetical portfolio, I'll allocate $5,000, or 10%, to Robinhood.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nLastly, there's Meta Platforms (META 1.95%). Simply put, Meta's fundamentals are too good to ignore. For example, over the last 12 months, here are some of the key figures the company has reported:\n\nOver the last five years, those figures increased by 127%, 183%, and 178%, respectively. By comparison, Home Depot, which generates roughly the same amount of annual revenue as Meta, grew revenue and net income by only 34% and 25%, respectively. Home Depot's free cash flow also fell by 7% over the last five years.\n\nMeta's fundamentals are growing shockingly fast for a company of its size. That's the power of scale, and it's a power that Meta wields, thanks to its global user base. The company has nearly 3.5 billion daily active users, so it can generate a staggering amount of advertising revenue.\n\nFurthermore, buy-and-hold investors should be rewarded for years to come, thanks to the company's strong free cash flow and fortress balance sheet. Although Meta only pays a meager dividend right now, the company will likely gradually increase it over the long run.\n\nFor my hypothetical portfolio, I'll allocate $25,000, or 50%, to Meta to round out my $50,000 investment pool."

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nThe SPY is actively trading near our pivotal mark of 593.73. Bulls aim for an early push upward, seeking to surpass the immediate hurdle at 595.14. Holding firm above 595.14 is essential, paving the way for buyers to secure a foothold at the 596.57 level. A strong bid here could generate additional upward momentum, carrying the price towards our subsequent target at 598.04, with our upper bull target for the session pegged at 599.24.\n\nShould the bulls falter at maintaining support at 593.73, bearish participants will target a swift move downward to test support at 592.00. Persistent selling pressure at this level might usher in further downside activity, directing price action towards 589.71. If sellers overwhelm buyers at this juncture, expect accelerated downward momentum toward robust support at 587.31, potentially extending to our ultimate bearish objective for the session at 585.75.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nThe Q's are hovering near our critical reference point of 519.87. Buyers need to initiate momentum, first reclaiming territory above the resistance at 521.15. If the bulls successfully fortify positions at this level, attention will shift to 522.57. Continued upward pressure could elevate price toward 523.91, with potential extension to the intermediate bullish milestone of 525.19. Our ambitious bull target for today sits at 527.03.\n\nConversely, failure to sustain the 519.87 zone during regular hours invites bearish aggression targeting a downward move towards 518.65. Should sellers assert dominance here, further selling could drive prices toward the lower area at 517.97. Continued weakness may then trigger extended declines, testing the resilience of support at 516.58, and ultimately opening pathways toward our bottom bear target at 515.00.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is currently trading in proximity to our benchmark level of 207.93. Bullish participants are eyeing initial stability above 208.81, with further upward acceleration expected if the price action securely holds this level. An ongoing bullish drive could lift prices to 209.81, with continued advancement pushing toward 211.12. A sustained bull rally may ultimately deliver Apple shares to our session's bullish high point at 212.44.\n\nShould buyers fail to protect the support at 207.93 during market hours, anticipate bearish attempts to break lower towards 207.18. If selling intensifies here, the next downside objective for bears lies at 206.55, with extended downward pressure bringing 205.54 into sharp focus. In scenarios marked by aggressive selling, price action could deteriorate further toward the daily bearish target set at 204.33.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft's shares are oscillating near our noted level of 457.25. Bulls are looking for sustained strength to break above the immediate resistance at 459.18, where stabilization will be key to further bullish action. Should this support hold firm, we foresee additional upside targeting 460.78. Persistent bullish buying could propel prices toward our optimistic bull-side target for the session at 462.07.\n\nIn the event that bullish momentum dissipates and support at 457.25 fails, bearish traders are likely to drive price downwards to probe initial support at 455.77. Continued selling pressure breaking this level could set up an accelerated descent to 453.02. Persistent bearish momentum could further depress prices toward the deeper support at 450.26, culminating in the bearish low target today at 448.18.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nLatest Startup Investment Opportunities:\n\nNVIDIA is actively transacting near our important level of 135.64. Bulls will seek to swiftly reclaim upward momentum by moving prices decisively through resistance at 136.98, solidifying this level as firm support. From here, bullish energy could surge upward to the next resistance area at 137.94. Continued optimism might trigger further gains toward 138.55, with the ultimate bullish target for NVIDIA set at 139.42.\n\nShould bullish control weaken around 135.64, bears will aggressively press downward toward initial support at 134.56. If selling continues unabated, expect subsequent downward tests of 133.31. Additional bearish pressure could lead the auction toward the deeper support at 132.19, and an aggressive bearish scenario could further stretch declines to our lower target at 131.42.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet shares are currently interacting around our pivotal level of 167.04. Bulls must ensure this support level remains robust, aiming for immediate upside towards 169.34. Sustained buying could enable further bullish momentum, driving price action toward the ambitious bullish target for today\u2019s session at 171.14.\n\nIf support at 167.04 is compromised during trading hours, bears will immediately look to drive prices lower toward 165.41. A breakdown here could spark further downside exploration to 163.79. In scenarios dominated by intensified selling, we anticipate a continued decline towards today's bearish downside target at 161.79.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is currently trading around our critical level of 635.49. Bullish traders seek immediate reinforcement of this support to push price upward toward 642.59. Sustained strength in buyer participation might facilitate additional bullish extension to 646.48. If bullish conditions persist, expect Meta to potentially rally up toward today's ambitious bull target of 650.56.\n\nShould the support at 635.49 give way under selling pressure, bears will likely accelerate selling towards 629.88. If sellers maintain their aggression, anticipate further downside to 622.01. A bearish scenario characterized by intense selling momentum could further pressure prices downward toward today\u2019s ultimate bearish target at 615.65.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla shares are trading close to our identified reference point of 346.64. Bulls need an initial breakout towards 350.87 to regain momentum. Continued strong buying activity could elevate prices to the next bullish zone at 356.80, with a broader market rally potentially lifting Tesla even further towards 363.84. A powerful bullish session might ultimately propel the price action toward our high bullish target of 370.22.\n\nOn the downside, if 346.64 fails as strong support today, bearish sentiment could swiftly target a drop to 340.97. Continued bearish aggression may then drive price action toward the deeper support at 333.93. If sellers succeed in breaking below the critical support at 327.59, anticipate the price to be pushed down aggressively toward today\u2019s bearish low at 322.52.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nEconomic news is relatively thin today, with primary focus likely shifting to the Fed speaker lineup. At 8:30 AM ET, traders will receive May's Philly Fed Non-Manufacturing Activity figures. Following this data, a series of Fed representatives will share insights, beginning with Bostic and Barkin (non-voting members) at 9:00 AM ET. Voting member Collins speaks at 9:30 AM ET, and Musalem, another voting member, is slated for commentary at 1:00 PM ET. Evening sessions feature Kugler at 5:00 PM ET and Daly at 7:00 PM ET, rounding out the day's Fed communications.\n\nGiven the sparse economic calendar, market participants will remain vigilant to any influential remarks from Fed members, geopolitical headlines, and developments regarding tariff negotiations. Traders should be prepared for potential volatility driven by these catalysts. Exercise caution, maintain strict risk management protocols, and have a successful trading day!\n\nThe Morning Memo is curated by RIPS, a pro trader with years of experience in equities, options, and futures trading. RIPS is at the heart of the exclusive Market Clubhouse community, offering his insights, expertise, and real-time mentorship.\n\nStart your day with a live daily market analysis, a carefully selected watch list, early access to the Morning Memo, and exclusive Market Clubhouse price levels, providing precise support and resistance indicators.

    "data": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.\n\nTake More Partial Profits On Tactical Trades\n\nConsider continuing to take partial profits on tactical trades that were initiated near the April lows.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, our Protection Band is being raised.\n\nU.S. Downgraded\n\nPlease click here for an enlarged chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT.\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe chart shows Treasuries were almost out of the danger zone marked on the chart.\n\nThe chart shows Treasuries have fallen below the danger zone on Moody's downgrading U.S. debt.\n\nThe chart shows Treasuries are now in zone 4 (support).\n\nThe chart shows Treasuries have not been this low since Fall 2023.\n\nHere is a historical perspective of what happened when Standard & Poor's downgraded U.S. debt in August 2011. The next trading session S&P 500 fell 6.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.6%. Over the following weeks, the market experienced heightened volatility with consecutive days with 4+% swings in either direction. The stock market dropped more than 20%, technically entering a bear market for a short period. By December 31, 2011, the market ended the year roughly flat.\n\nIn our analysis, the impact of the downgrade is likely to be muted and very different from 2011 for the following reasons: Moody's is simply 14 years too late. Based on the data, Moody's should have downgraded U.S. debt in 2011. There is no new information in Moody's downgrade. In 2011, the S&P 500 downgrade was a shock. Now, there is nothing new here. Stock market bulls are pinning their hopes on President Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" The House Budget Committee advanced the reconciliation bill. The bill includes both tax cuts and spending cuts and a debt ceiling increase. The House will likely vote later this week. The momo crowd is now more powerful than ever. The momo crowd does not do any analysis and does not take risk into account. The momo crowd simply buys every stock market dip on hopium.\n\nIn the early trade, true to its pattern, the momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks, taking advantage of about a 1% dip in the stock market on the downgrade.\n\nPrudent investors should pay attention to the latest University of Michigan data. Here are the key points: Consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 vs. 55 consensus. As a reference, at the same time last year, the index was at 69.1. Inflation expectations for the year ahead increased from 6.5% to 7.3%.\n\nIn our analysis, this particular set of data on consumer sentiment is flawed because it was before President Trump gave China the greatest deal ever. President Trump's action has reduced consumer anxiety about tariffs in the short term.\n\nLeading Indicators were released today at 10am ET.\n\nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), and Tesla Inc (TSLA).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin has been very volatile after the U.S. downgrade. The Senate is likely to pass the stablecoin bill. This will be the first big legislative win for the crypto industry after President Trump's re-election.\n\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

    "data": "The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.20%) closed Wednesday at 19,146.81 -- a staggering 29.5% rally from its 52-week intraday low of 14,784.03 on April 7.\n\nTrade tensions are easing. Reciprocal tariffs are being paused or cut. The economy is showing resiliency. Big banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase just reduced their recession odds forecasts. In sum, a renewed wave of investor optimism is rippling through the market.\n\nOf course, there's always the \"stroke of the pen risk\" that policies change and tensions flare once more. However, with a prolonged trade war now likely avoided, investors can shift their focus back to building their portfolios around quality companies.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be simple and effective ways to achieve diversification and invest in several companies at once. Investment management firm Vanguard offers low-cost ETFs with expense ratios of 0.1% or lower that target multiple themes, such as growth stocks.\n\nHere's why the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG 1.03%), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.95%), and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR 1.28%) are soaring and could be worth buying now.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF has over 54% of its allocation in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Broadcom, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Those stocks were getting crushed when trade tensions were mounting. However, they have also been the companies leading the broader rebound in the major indexes.\n\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF is similar to the Nasdaq Composite in both holdings and long-term performance. Over the last 10 years, the Nasdaq Composite has posted a total return (gains plus dividends) of 279.1% compared to 277.4% for the Vanguard Growth ETF and 177.8% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.03%).\n\nHowever, the Vanguard Growth ETF isn't bogged down by index limitations. Some major growth stocks are on the New York Stock Exchange, not the Nasdaq Composite, such as drugmaker Eli Lilly and tech giant Oracle. ETFs that focus only on Nasdaq stocks, like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 1.01%), don't invest in these names. And the Invesco QQQ also sports a 0.2% expense ratio -- which is five times higher than the 0.04% expense ratio of the Vanguard Growth ETF.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nThis ETF mirrors the tech sector's performance. It holds 310 components, but a handful of stocks drive its gains. Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft make up a staggering 46.3% of the fund due to their sheer size. After all, these are the three most valuable companies in the world. And all three stocks have been rallying hard on news of easing trade tensions.\n\nDespite being much higher today than it was a few weeks ago, the ETF could still be worth buying now if you believe in the competitive advantages of top tech companies.\n\nApple has an integrated ecosystem that blends hardware and software across devices -- with a growing services segment that keeps consumers engaged. Apple generates so much extra cash and is so confident in the value of its stock that it authorized a $100 billion stock repurchase program earlier this month.\n\nMicrosoft is arguably one of the best all-around growth stocks to buy now due to its diversified business model, steady high-margin growth across cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), hardware, and software, an impeccable balance sheet, and a massive capital return program.\n\nNvidia stands to benefit from increased AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Despite tariff turmoil, hyperscaler spending remains at record highs.\n\nInstead of pulling back on AI spending amid economic uncertainty, Meta Platforms announced on its latest earnings call that it would increase its capital expenditures. Cloud infrastructure giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Cloud, and Google Cloud are all ramping up investments to meet customer demands.\n\nIn sum, investing in a technology sector fund is a great way to concentrate capital on top themes like AI and cloud computing.\n\nVanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector is a coiled spring for economic growth. 35.3% of the fund is concentrated in Amazon and Tesla. But beyond that, the fund includes a variety of cyclical sectors that tend to grow in lockstep with the broader economy, like home improvement giants Home Depot and Lowe's Companies, and travel giant Booking Holdings.\n\nConsumer discretionary tends to be one of the hardest hit sectors during a sell-off, but it can also rally quickly when sentiment shifts positively.\n\nThe sector is sensitive to economic readings like unemployment and GDP. The sector can boom when consumer spending is high, the economy is growing, and unemployment is low. But these same factors can be a double-edged sword when the economy is contracting.\n\nInvestors looking for a fund built around Amazon and Tesla may want to take a closer look at the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF.\n\nInvesting in growth stocks with a long-term mindset\n\nAlthough the discussed ETFs have been surging in lockstep with the rebound in the Nasdaq Composite, investors should make sure they are buying stocks and ETFs for the right reasons and not just riding the market rally higher for a quick gain.\n\nBecause all three ETFs are so concentrated in a handful of names, they can be highly volatile to the upside and the downside. So, it's important to want to own the top holdings in each ETF before putting your hard-earned savings to work.\n\nETFs can be excellent plug-and-play tools for aligning investments with financial objectives by getting exposure to top stocks. However, investors looking for less volatility may want to steer clear of the discussed ETFs and look for more diversified funds that aren't so top-heavy."

    "data": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of seven American companies with leadership positions in various segments of the technology industry. They got the nickname in 2023 because of their incredible size and their ability to consistently outperform the rest of the stock market.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies have a combined value of $16.7 trillion, which represents 31.6% of the entire value of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), so they have an enormous influence over the performance of the index.\n\nWhen Microsoft (MSFT 0.58%), Nvidia (NVDA 1.26%), Apple (AAPL 1.79%), Amazon (AMZN 2.77%), Alphabet (GOOG 3.02%) (GOOGL 3.24%), Meta Platforms (META 1.95%), and Tesla (TSLA 3.85%) are moving higher as a group, investors who don't own them will generally underperform the S&P 500.\n\nI'm going to introduce you to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has more than half of the entire value of its portfolio invested in the Magnificent Seven stocks. It's the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 1.07%), and it has consistently beaten the S&P 500 every year since it was established in 2007. Here's why investors might want to buy it for the long term.\n\nA concentrated ETF filled with America's highest-quality companies\n\nSome ETFs hold hundreds or even thousands of different stocks. But the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF holds just 69, and the Magnificent Seven account for 54.9% of the total value of its portfolio:\n\nStock Vanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Apple 13.37% 2. Microsoft 12.24% 3. Nvidia 10.48% 4. Amazon 7.20% 5. Alphabet 4.19% 6. Meta Platforms 4.02% 7. Tesla 3.42%\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) could fuel the next phase of growth for each of the Magnificent Seven companies, but in very different ways. Apple, for example, designed a series of chips for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers to run its new Apple Intelligence software. It provides a suite of AI features, including writing tools and a more powerful version of the Siri voice assistant, which transform the user experience for people with Apple devices.\n\nTesla is another consumer \"hardware\" company that has turned its attention to AI. The electric vehicle (EV) giant continues to improve its AI-powered full self-driving software, which could be active on public roads as soon as this year.\n\nNvidia supplies the world's best data center chips for developing AI models. Apple Intelligence wouldn't be possible without it, nor would Tesla's self-driving software. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are also some of Nvidia's top customers -- they fill their cloud data centers with AI chips and rent the computing power to developers for a profit.\n\nTheir cloud platforms also offer access to the latest ready-made large language models (LLMs) to help accelerate their customers' AI software ambitions.\n\nThen there is Meta Platforms, which uses AI in its recommendation algorithm to show users more of the content they enjoy seeing on its Facebook and Instagram. It also launched an AI assistant last year called Meta AI, which already has nearly a billion users. The company's Llama family of LLMs that power Meta AI have become the most popular open-source models in the world.\n\nAlthough the Magnificent Seven stocks dominate the Vanguard ETF, it does offer some diversification. Large-cap non-technology stocks like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's are also among the ETF's top 20 positions.\n\nThis Vanguard ETF can help investors beat the S&P 500\n\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF delivered a compound annual return of 12.5% since its inception in 2007, comfortably beating the average annual gain of 9.6% in the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nBut the ETF has a highly concentrated portfolio, which can be a recipe for volatility. For example, the S&P 500 fell by as much as 18.9% from its all-time high earlier this year as economic and political uncertainty surged due to President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. However, the ETF was down by 22.3% at the same time, because it has much larger positions in the high-flying Magnificent Seven stocks, which pulled back more sharply than the rest of the market amid the chaos.\n\nAs a result, investors shouldn't put all of their eggs in one basket. Instead, they should buy the ETF as part of a balanced portfolio, where it has the potential to boost overall returns.\n\nFor example, using the returns cited earlier, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would be worth $15,814 in five years. But if you invest $5,000 in the S&P and $5,000 in the Vanguard ETF, your $10,000 could be worth $16,917 instead.\n\nOne thing is for certain: Investors will want exposure to the Magnificent Seven, not only because of their excellent long-term track record, but also because they are leading the way when it comes to new technologies like AI."

    "data": "In the first 100 days of 2025, as Donald Trump began his second presidential term, the stock market experienced one of its worst starts in decades, wiping out billions in investor wealth.\n\nAmong those who were hurt and are now looking to play defense with investments are large pension funds.\n\nWhat Happened: The California State Teachers' Retirement System, also known as CalSTRS, has a large portfolio with thousands of stocks and other investments.\n\nEarlier this year, CalSTRS Chief Investment Officer Scott Chan said the pension fund was facing \"unprecedented and world-changing\" risks, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"What's changed to the negative is fairly unique because its almost entirely related to policy,\" Chan said.\n\nChan's comments referred to the Trump administration\u2019s constant policy changes, including tariffs, which have created market uncertainty.\n\n\"Today's storm is different. We don't know what the shock is,\" Chan said in March.\n\nChan said tariffs and a possible recession are top concerns, along with geopolitical tensions like the role the U.S. plays in conflicts like the war between Russia and Ukraine and the future of NATO.\n\n\"Those are geopolitical types of risks that would be extremely hard to navigate from a portfolio perspective.\"\n\nLooking back at Chan's comments today might make a portfolio change made in the first quarter. According to a report from Quiver Quantitative, CalSTRS added to its stake in Trump Media & Technology Group DJT in the quarter.\n\nAs of the end of March, the pension fund owns 95,463 shares of DJT worth $1.87 million. The position was increased by 21,004 shares in the quarter or 28%.\n\nWhile this makes up a small part of the portfolio, Chan has concerns about the economy under Trump. The fund, he says, would play defense with fixed income and cash.\n\nAlso consider that the fund lowered its stake in some of the top holdings and large companies during the quarter. That includes its top five holdings:\n\nApple Inc AAPL : 6.5% of fund\n\n: 6.5% of fund Microsoft Corporation MSFT : 5.2%\n\n: 5.2% NVIDIA Corporation NVDA : 5.2%\n\n: 5.2% Amazon.com Inc AMZN : 3.5%\n\n: 3.5% Meta Platforms META : 2.5%\n\nThe fund lowered positions in those names, while DJT was one of the names to see an increase in the quarter. While Trump Media & Technology is not tired directly to the economic performance of Trump or his policies, some investors or members of the pension may not like seeing their money invested in a company that counts the president as the largest stakeholder.\n\nCalSTRS has a 30-year target of producing annual returns of 7% to meet retirement obligations. A drop in the stock market and underperformers like Trump Media could put those returns at risk.\n\nTrump Media stock is down 25.2% year-to-date in 2025 and down over 50% in the last year.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold With Our Easy-to-Use Tool\n\nTesla Investment: Along with an investment in Trump Media that might not please all pension members, portfolio holding Tesla Inc TSLA has also been the subject of controversy.\n\nCalSTRS received 38 emails in the first three months of 2025 asking the pension fund to sell its Tesla stake. Another email request asked the fund to sell anything related to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe comments came in as Musk was working with the Department of Government Efficiency to cut federal jobs and having staffers disrupt the Department of Education to look for waste and funds to cut.\n\n\"These are difficult times that call for more than ordinary actions,\" Edward Hasbrouck, spouse of a teacher who's a beneficiary of the pension fund, told CalSTRS at the meeting. \"You have ample fiscal reasons to sell that Tesla stock, but in selling it, you will be doing more than your fiduciary responsibility. You'll also be doing the right thing.\"\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the pension fund owned 4,493,611 Tesla shares worth $1.16 billion. The position made up 1.5% of the fund's assets according to Quiver Quantitative. The Tesla holdings decreased by 7,476 shares, or 0.17% in the quarter.\n\nLoading...

    "data": "To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.\n\nHot Stocks\n\nPlease click here for an enlarged chart of iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA).\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe chart shows the recent steep upward trendline of aerospace and defense stocks.\n\nThe chart shows when ITA broke out.\n\nThe chart shows RSI has been overbought and flat. This indicates that the up move is very powerful and after a shallow dip, these stocks may go higher.\n\nITA has outperformed S&P 500 by 16.68% year to date. This shows the power of picking the right sectors.\n\nAs full disclosure, Aerospace and defense ETF ITA is in our ZYX Allocation Model Portfolio. The top three holdings of ITA are General Electric Co (GE), Rtx Corp (RTX), and Boeing Co (BA). RTX and BA are in our ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio.\n\n(GE), (RTX), and (BA). RTX and BA are in our ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio. The trigger behind the big move in aerospace stocks are the large deals that President Trump has been striking to sell U.S. planes and weapons to Arab countries.\n\nAs a reader of our report, you were already in the know that the momo crowd was extremely aggressively buying call options. Today, about $3T notional value of options will expire. As the momo crowd extremely aggressively bought call options and the stock market rose, market makers were buying stocks to hedge. Stock buying by market makers has, in part, been responsible for the steep rise in the stock market.\n\nStarting Monday, a new cycle will begin for options. Expect more volatility depending upon how aggressively the momo crowd buys call options. Depending upon how the market behaves, market makers may unwind some hedges.\n\nPrudent investors should pay attention that the put call ratio is very low at this point. This indicates extreme bullishness. This is one of the indicators in our proprietary sentiment indicator. The Arora Sentiment Indicator is extremely bullish. As we have been sharing with you, extremely bullish sentiment is a contrary indicator, i.e. a sell signal. We have also been sharing with you that sentiment is not a precise timing indicator. This is one of the reasons that our call yesterday was to take partial profits on tactical positions.\n\nRight now, in the middle of all the bullishness, the momo crowd is not paying attention, but prudent investors should \u2013 there are reports that Japan may hold out for a better trade deal. After all, if China can get everything China wanted without giving anything material in return, why cannot Japan get a better deal? As a reference, the Trump administration has been touting Japan as a country willing to give the U.S. a great deal. The Japanese government appears to be concerned about a backlash from the Japanese public if it gives the U.S. a great deal.\n\nUniversity of Michigan Consumer Sentiment will be released at 10am ET and may be market moving.\n\nHousing Starts\n\nNew housing market is weakening.\n\nHousing starts came at 1.361M vs. 1.383M consensus.\n\nBuilding permits came at 1.412M vs. 1.450M consensus.\n\nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), and Tesla Inc (TSLA).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Meta Platforms Inc (META).\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is range bound.\n\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is trading around the 592.00 region to begin the day. If buyers are able to establish control early, we'd like to see price climb toward 593.73. Holding above that level would suggest further upside momentum, potentially bringing 595.14 into play as a key support zone. If bulls remain in charge, the tape could rally further to challenge 596.57. A strong buyer-led session could stretch up to our high target at 598.04.\n\nShould 592.00 fail to attract support, attention turns to 589.71 as the next line of defense. A break below that could open the door to 587.31, with increased selling pushing us into deeper territory. If downside pressure intensifies, we'll be watching for a retest of 585.75. In an aggressive sell-off, 584.68 marks our low bear objective.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is currently trading around the 519.87 level. If bulls can maintain strength above this zone, a push toward 521.15 would be the first objective. Sustaining that move sets the stage for a continuation to 522.57. If momentum builds, we could see an advance to 523.91, with 525.19 acting as a key resistance pivot. Should the rally extend, the high bull target of 527.03 could be in reach.\n\nIf bulls can't hold 519.87, we anticipate sellers stepping in to test 518.65. Should this level fold, the next support we're monitoring is 517.97. Additional selling pressure may drag the price toward 516.58, with the final level of downside interest at 515.00, which serves as our low target for the bears today.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple is hovering around the 211.12 level. If buyers show interest and defend this area, we're watching for a push up to 212.44. Continued upside participation could drive the stock to 214.07. If bulls stay aggressive, 215.25 is our upside target for today, capping off a strong bullish run.\n\nIf 211.12 fails to act as support, sellers will likely drive price toward 209.81. Breaking that would bring 208.81 into focus. Sustained bearish momentum could expose 207.93, and if pressure accelerates, our low downside objective for Apple is 207.18.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is currently near the 453.02 area. If bulls hold this ground and step in with volume, we want to see a move toward 455.77. Maintaining that level as support sets up a path to 457.25. With continued buying strength, price could extend to our top-side target for the session at 459.18.\n\nIf 453.02 breaks down under pressure, the next key level we'll be watching is 450.26. Should bears stay aggressive, look for 448.18 as a possible resting spot for sellers. If bearish control strengthens, the auction could reach down to 446.33, with our low bear target sitting at 444.95.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is trading around the 135.64 level. If buyers show strength early, we want to see a climb to 136.98. Holding that area as support could spark a move to 137.94. Should momentum continue building, 138.55 becomes the next upside level, with 139.42 as the high bull target on the day.\n\nIf 135.64 fails to hold, the focus shifts to 134.56. A breakdown below that level could accelerate selling to 133.31. Continued weakness would bring 132.19 into view, and if the auction can't stabilize, NVIDIA may trade down to 131.42 as the low bear target.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is auctioning near 165.41 to start the session. If buyers defend this area, we're eyeing a push to 167.04. Sustained upside momentum from there could take price into the 169.34 zone, which stands as the high bull target for today.\n\nIf 165.41 fails as a support level, the bears may look to bring the price down to 163.79. If selling intensifies, we'll watch for a test of 161.79. Further pressure could drag the auction toward our low target for the day at 160.36.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is auctioning near 642.59. Bulls will want to hold this level and look for continuation higher toward 646.48. If that level flips to support, we could see a push to 650.56. Sustained bullish momentum could drive the session as high as 655.54, which is our upside target.\n\nShould 642.59 break, the bears will look to drive price toward 635.49. Continued pressure could take Meta down to 629.88. If this area fails to hold, we anticipate a slide toward 622.01, which marks our low bear target on the day.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is currently positioned around 346.64. Bulls will aim to drive the auction higher toward 350.87. With strong buyer interest, the price could rally up to 356.80. If this upside trend persists, 363.84 comes into play, and our high target for Tesla today sits at 370.22.\n\nIf 346.64 breaks down, we'll look for sellers to take it down to 340.97. A continuation of sell-side momentum would likely bring 333.93 into play. If this level folds, we could see further weakness down to our low bear target at 327.59.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday's trading session brings a packed economic calendar, starting with Housing Starts, Import Prices, and Building Permits for April hitting the tape at 8:30AM ET, alongside the NY Fed Services Index.

    "data": "Good Morning Traders! In today\u2019s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market\u2019s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let\u2019s dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n\nSPY is currently rotating near our 585.75 reference level. For buyers to maintain control, we\u2019d like to see price move up to 587.31 and establish that level as a support base. Should bulls remain dominant, the next upside objective is 589.71. Holding 589.71 during regular trading could open the door to a further move toward 592.00. If momentum remains on the buyers\u2019 side, the high bull objective for the day is marked at 593.73.\n\nIf 585.75 loses footing as a support area, we'll be watching 584.68 as the next key level to monitor. If pressure builds and sellers stay active, the downside may extend to 583.18. A breakdown beneath that could lead to further weakness toward 581.97. Should sentiment shift dramatically to the downside, the low bear objective on the day stands at 580.67.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)\n\nQQQ is currently hovering near our level of 516.58. Bulls need to gain ground above 517.97 and solidify that area as a stable base. A firm hold could lead to a challenge of 518.65, and if strength persists, 519.87 may come into play. Should buyers stay aggressive, we anticipate a possible extension to 521.15. The top-side goal for bulls today is set at 522.57.\n\nIf the auction struggles to stay buoyant above 516.58, sellers may drive the price toward 515.00. Breaking below that level could invite further downside exploration to 513.64. A sustained bearish session may bring 511.53 into play, and if that floor fails to hold, we are targeting 509.87 as the session's lower bear target.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL\n\nApple is trading close to our level of 209.81. If bulls want to take charge, they'll need to secure 211.12 and convert it into a platform for higher prices. Holding that zone may propel the stock toward 212.44. Continued strength in the name could push price to 214.07, with the high-side bull objective standing at 215.25.\n\nShould 209.81 fall through, we'll look to 208.81 for initial support. If sellers persist, a test of 207.93 could follow. Continued downward action may lead to 207.18 being probed, and if pressure intensifies further, our low bear target sits at 206.55.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading near 450.26. If bulls are able to hold this area and drive price higher, the next upside target is 453.02. A clean move above and hold of this level during market hours could bring 455.77 into view. If bullish energy sustains, the upper boundary we're eyeing for today is 457.25.\n\nOn the downside, if 450.26 can't hold up, expect bears to aim for 448.18. A breakdown there could see the stock testing 446.33, with pressure building into 444.95 if sellers stay committed. Should the auction extend to deeper lows, the low bear target is marked at 442.95.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is actively trading near 134.56. A bullish continuation would require price to push above 135.64 and turn it into a support floor. If that transition occurs, look for 136.98 to be challenged next. A healthy bid could bring price action to 137.94, with bulls aiming for a top-side target at 138.55.\n\nIf the bulls can't keep 134.56 intact, we expect the bears to pressure the stock lower toward 133.31. Failing that level could invite sellers to test 132.19. If momentum remains with the bears, 131.42 could be visited, and the session's low-side bear target is placed at 129.53.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is currently auctioning near 163.79. For bulls to stay in control, they need to establish 165.41 as a solid base and push toward 167.04. A sustained rally today could push price toward our upside objective of 169.34.\n\nIf 163.79 fails to act as support, the next area of interest lies at 161.79. A break below there may see the auction retreat to 160.36. Continued weakness could send the name down to our low-end target of 158.54.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META)\n\nMeta is auctioning near our level of 650.56. Bulls will want to maintain strength above this area and attempt a move to 655.54. If the momentum holds, the price may rally to 658.86. Should buyers remain in control, our high bull target of 663.33 becomes the key upside marker.\n\nShould 650.56 give out, the first line of defense for the bulls is at 646.48. Selling pressure below that level could drag the price down to 642.59. If sellers remain dominant, the lower target for the day is 635.49.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla is currently revolving around 340.97. For a bullish day, price needs to climb toward 346.64 and hold it as firm support. If momentum follows through, the next step is 350.87. With sustained buying, 356.80 becomes the next potential area of interest. The bullish stretch target sits at 363.84.\n\nIf 340.97 doesn't hold, we'll be eyeing 333.93 as the next level under pressure. A breakdown through that opens the path to 327.59. If selling intensifies, 322.52 becomes the likely bear target to the downside.\n\nFinal Word:\n\nToday's session is packed with market-moving data. At 8:30AM ET, we'll see the release of April's PPI Final Demand along with Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims. Also hitting the tape at that time are the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index and Empire State Manufacturing Survey\u2014both key sentiment indicators. At 9:15AM ET, attention shifts to Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, and Manufacturing Output, all offering a deeper look into real economic activity. At 10AM ET, housing data comes into focus with the NAHB Housing Market Index.\n\nFed commentary also plays a major role today, with Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak at 8:40AM ET, followed by remarks from FOMC's Barr at 2:05PM ET. With inflation, labor, manufacturing, and housing data all hitting at once, combined with Fed commentary, the market may experience heightened volatility. Stay sharp, manage your risk, and be ready to adapt as the data unfolds.\n\nFor a limited time during our special promotion, you can join RIPS and get a full access pass to Market Clubhouse for 7 full days for just $7.
