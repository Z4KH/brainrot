Final Position: {'justification': "The debate history and structured data show a strong consensus among agents that NVIDIA is poised for short-term growth. Key factors include the recent surge to an all-time high of $950.02, up3.2% following the announcement of a new AI chip architecture, and Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion, up265% year-over-year. Data center revenue reached $18.4 billion, driven by AI infrastructure demand. Analyst consensus raising the price target to $1,100 and multiple firms upgrading the stock rating to 'Strong Buy' further supports a bullish outlook. The company's expansion into new areas such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and partnerships with major cloud providers is expected to drive continued growth.\n\nHowever, potential risks include regulatory scrutiny over AI market dominance and increasing competition from AMD and Intel. Despite these risks, the consistent bullish outlook and strong data justify a 'Buy' position. The projected percentage change of +8.0% over48 hours reflects the potential for continued short-term growth driven by these factors. The confidence level of0.85 is high due to strong earnings reports, analyst upgrades, and positive market sentiment, but not at the maximum due to potential regulatory and competitive risks.", 'position': 'Buy', 'asset': 'NVIDIA', 'projected_change': 8.0, 'time_horizon': 48.0, 'confidence': 0.85}

    Justification:  
    The debate history shows a strong consensus among agents that NVIDIA is poised for short-term growth. Key factors include the recent surge to an all-time high of $950.02, up3.2% following the announcement of a new AI chip architecture, and Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion, up265% year-over-year. Data center revenue reached $18.4 billion, driven by AI infrastructure demand. Analyst consensus raising the price target to $1,100 and multiple firms upgrading the stock rating to 'Strong Buy' further supports a bullish outlook. The company's expansion into new areas such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and partnerships with major cloud providers are expected to drive continued growth.
