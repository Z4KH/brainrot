Justification:  The portfolio currently holds 7000 shares of NVDA purchased at $131.29, currently valued at $135.13, resulting in a profit. Recent price history shows volatility, with prices fluctuating between $134.81 and $139.19 in the last week.  The structured data reveals mixed signals. While some sources highlight strong Q1 earnings and continued AI demand, others express concern over China export restrictions and their potential impact on future sales.  The news regarding China restrictions is particularly impactful, as it directly affects NVDA's revenue. Given the uncertainty and the existing profit, a cautious approach is warranted.
