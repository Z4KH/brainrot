Justification:  The current portfolio shows a profit on NVDA holdings. Recent price history indicates a slight upward trend, culminating in a current price of $117.37.  While some news sources express concern regarding tariffs and export restrictions (e.g.,  "Nvidia Faces Bill to Halt Chip Smuggling," "Nvidia Faces Scrutiny as U.S. Lawmaker Proposes Chip-Tracking Rules"), other sources highlight positive sentiment and bullish predictions (e.g., "NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Among Billionaire Bruce Kovnerâ€™s Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential," "Nvidia stock rises on report Trump will rescind AI chip curbs"). The overall news sentiment appears mixed, but the recent price increase suggests a positive short-term outlook.  Given the existing profit and the potential for further short-term gains based on positive news, a short-term hold and potential for a small increase is predicted.
