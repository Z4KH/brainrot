Justification:  The recent price history shows a consistent upward trend for NVDA, culminating in a current price of $139.19.  The portfolio currently holds 7000 shares purchased at $131.29, representing a profit.  Multiple news sources highlight strong Q1 earnings for NVDA, exceeding expectations and driven by AI-related demand.
