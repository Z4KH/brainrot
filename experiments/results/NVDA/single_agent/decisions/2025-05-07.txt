Justification:  The recent price history shows a consistent upward trend, culminating in a significant jump on 2025-05-07 ($117.06) following reports that the Trump administration plans to repeal AI chip export restrictions.  Multiple news sources (Yahoo, DowJones, Finnhub, MarketWatch) corroborate this positive news impacting NVDA. While some sources express caution regarding potential headwinds (e.g., Super Micro's difficulties, AMD's China revenue hit), the overwhelmingly positive sentiment surrounding the repeal of export restrictions suggests a continued short-term upward trajectory.  The current portfolio holds a profitable position in NVDA, allowing for further investment with reduced risk.
