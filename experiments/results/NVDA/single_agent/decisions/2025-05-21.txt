Justification:  The current portfolio shows a profit on NVDA, with 586 shares purchased at $129.60 and a current price of $131.80. Recent price history reveals a downward trend, from $134.83 on 05-15-2025 to $131.80 on 05-21-2025.  The structured data contains mixed signals; some sources suggest a buy (Citi lifts NVDA to Buy with $150 target), while others express concerns about US chip policy impacting NVDA's market share in China and overall market anxieties.  Given the recent price decline and the uncertainty highlighted in the news, a cautious approach is warranted.  Securing profits from the current position is prioritized over potential further gains.
