Justification:  The current portfolio shows a profit on NVDA holdings. Recent price history indicates some volatility but a generally upward trend, with the price hovering around $116.65.  Multiple news sources mention NVDA favorably in relation to AI growth and potential upside, despite concerns about import tariffs and economic uncertainty.  While some sources express caution ("HOLD" recommendation), others are bullish, projecting significant price increases. The potential for the Trump administration to ease AI chip export restrictions, as reported by several sources, could significantly benefit NVDA.  Given the current profit and positive sentiment surrounding the stock, a short-term hold with potential for a small increase is a reasonable strategy.
