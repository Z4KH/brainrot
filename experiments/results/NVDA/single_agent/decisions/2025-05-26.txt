Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight downward trend for NVDA, with the price decreasing from $135.57 on 05-19-2025 to $131.29 on 05-23-2025.  The structured data contains mixed signals. Several sources express concerns regarding NVDA's Q1 earnings and the impact of export restrictions to China ("Nvidia: Expect It To Lose Most First Quarter China Business," "Why I'm Downgrading Nvidia Ahead Of Its Q1," "Nvidia’s stock is losing steam, and this week’s earnings could underscore the risks"). However, other sources highlight positive aspects, such as the launch of a cheaper AI chip for the Chinese market ("Nvidia prepares lighter Blackwell chip for China in response to US restrictions") and significant deals ("$600B AI Opportunity: Nvidia's 18,000-Chip Deal With Saudi Arabia's Humain").  Given the current portfolio is already at a loss and the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming earnings report, a wait-and-see approach is the most prudent strategy.
