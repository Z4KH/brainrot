Justification:  The recent price history shows volatility, with a peak at $139.19 on 05-29-2025 followed by a drop to $135.13 on 05-30-2025.  The structured data reveals mixed sentiment. While some sources highlight positive developments like Nvidia's deal with OpenAI and strong Q1 results, others express concern over export restrictions to China and potential losses.  The current portfolio holds a profit on NVDA, suggesting a potential opportunity to secure gains. However, the uncertainty surrounding the China market and the recent price drop warrant caution.  A wait-and-see approach minimizes risk while allowing for further market observation.
