Justification:  The portfolio currently holds 7000 shares of NVDA purchased at $131.29, currently valued at $134.81, showing a profit. Recent price history indicates a slight upward trend, with the price fluctuating between $131.29 and $135.50 in the last week.  The structured data reveals mixed signals. While several sources highlight strong Q1 earnings and positive future prospects driven by AI demand, others mention concerns about export restrictions to China impacting future sales and causing a revenue shortfall.  The overall sentiment is positive, but the uncertainty regarding the impact of China-related issues warrants caution.  Given the existing profit and the mixed signals, a conservative approach is recommended.
