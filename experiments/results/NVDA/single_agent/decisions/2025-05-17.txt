Justification:  
The recent price history shows a steady upward trend for NVDA, culminating in a price of $135.40 on 2025-05-16.  The structured data overwhelmingly points to continued positive sentiment surrounding NVDA due to its dominant position in the AI chip market.  Multiple sources highlight significant deals with Saudi Arabia, potentially leading to substantial future revenue.
