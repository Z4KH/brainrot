Justification:  The recent price history shows a strong upward trend for NVDA, increasing from $117.37 on 05-08-2025 to $135.34 on 05-14-2025.  The structured data overwhelmingly supports a bullish outlook for NVDA. Multiple sources highlight significant AI-related deals, particularly with Saudi Arabia,  resulting in price target increases and positive analyst commentary.  The rescission of export restrictions on AI chips further boosts the positive sentiment. Although Bridgewater Associates sold some NVDA shares, the overall news flow is strongly positive.  The current portfolio holds NVDA at a profit, providing a cushion against potential short-term losses.
