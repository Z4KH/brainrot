Justification:  The current portfolio shows a profit on NVDA, with 645 shares purchased at $113.09 and a current price of $116.65. Recent price history shows some volatility, but a general upward trend over the past week.  While some news sources mention potential downgrades and China-related concerns (e.g., "Nvidia downgrades chip, Cloudflare outlook, Affirm disappoints," "Nvidia Stock Falls. Why a New AI Chip Wonâ€™t Fix Its China Problems."), other sources highlight continued optimism and strong AI demand ("AI Stocks Are Back (MSFT, NVDA, PLTR)", "3 Reasons Nvidia Stock Is Still a Top Artificial Intelligence Buy Right Now").  The mixed signals suggest a relatively neutral outlook for the next day, with the potential for small gains or losses.  Given the existing profit and the uncertainty, a wait-and-see approach is prudent.
