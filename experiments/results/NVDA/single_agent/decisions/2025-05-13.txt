Justification:  The recent price history shows a strong upward trend, culminating in a significant jump on 2025-05-13 ($129.93).  Multiple news sources (Yahoo, Finnhub) report a major deal between NVIDIA and Saudi Arabia for the development of AI infrastructure, involving the sale of thousands of AI chips. This positive news, coupled with the already established upward trend, strongly suggests continued short-term growth.  The portfolio currently holds NVDA at a profit, making a short-term sell decision less attractive.
