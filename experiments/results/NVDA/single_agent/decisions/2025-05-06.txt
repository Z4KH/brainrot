Justification:  The current portfolio shows a profit on NVDA, with 645 shares purchased at $112.40 and a current price of $113.54. Recent price history shows some volatility, with a slight downward trend from $114.50 on 05-02-2025 to $113.54 on 05-06-2025.  However, the numerous news articles highlight continued strong interest in AI and NVDA's central role in the AI market, despite concerns about China trade restrictions and competition from AMD.  The positive sentiment surrounding NVDA's position in the AI sector outweighs the short-term price fluctuation and potential risks associated with trade uncertainties.
