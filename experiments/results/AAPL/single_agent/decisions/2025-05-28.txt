Justification:  The recent price history shows some volatility, with a slight upward trend after a dip on 05-23-2025.  The current price is $200.42.  The structured data reveals significant uncertainty surrounding Apple due to President Trump's threats of tariffs on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S.  While some analysts suggest a limited impact, the overall sentiment is negative, creating considerable risk.  A Seeking Alpha article suggests a fair value of $174, implying potential downside.  However, other sources express bullish sentiment and predict future growth.  Given the conflicting information and high risk associated with the political uncertainty, a cautious approach is warranted.
