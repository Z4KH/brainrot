Justification:  Apple's stock price has been declining over the past week, from $213.04 on 05-01-2025 to $198.25 on 05-06-2025.  Recent news articles express mixed sentiment, with some analysts suggesting a "Hold" or "Sell" due to muted growth, valuation concerns, and tariff impacts (SeekingAlpha, Yahoo Finance).  Others maintain a "Buy" rating citing strong Q2 earnings and potential for growth (Yahoo Finance, SeekingAlpha). However, the recent price decline and the significant number of "Sell" or "Hold" recommendations outweigh the positive sentiment.  The $900 million tariff impact projected for the June quarter, as stated by CEO Tim Cook, further contributes to the negative outlook for the short term.  The portfolio currently holds no AAPL shares.
