Justification:  Apple's recent price history shows some volatility but a general upward trend.  While the price dipped slightly from its peak on 05-13-2025 ($212.93) to the current price of $211.45, the overall trend over the past week is positive.  News sources indicate that Berkshire Hathaway maintained its significant stake in Apple, suggesting continued confidence in the company.  Although some news articles mention potential challenges (e.g., Trump's comments on iPhone production, concerns about consumer slowdown), the overall sentiment regarding Apple remains relatively positive, particularly given the recent tariff reductions between the US and China.  My current portfolio shows a profit on Apple stock, and the available balance allows for further investment.
