Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight upward trend, with AAPL increasing from $199.95 on 05-29-2025 to $200.85 on 05-30-2025.  While several news sources mention potential negative impacts from tariffs and slowing growth in China, other sources highlight positive factors such as a court blocking some tariffs ("Apple Rebound Likely as Court Blocks Tariff Sell-Off Catalyst"),  Warren Buffett's continued investment, and the anticipation of a new iOS user interface ("Shimmers, floating toolbars, and radical transparency: Here's what iOS 26 could look like"). The overall sentiment is mixed, but the recent price increase suggests a short-term positive momentum.  The current portfolio holds a profitable position in AAPL, providing a buffer against potential losses.
