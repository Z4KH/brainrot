Justification:  Apple's stock price has been declining over the past week, dropping from $208.78 on 05-19-2025 to $195.27 on 05-23-2025.  The recent news regarding President Trump's tariff threats on iPhones manufactured outside the US (multiple sources: Yahoo, MarketWatch, Finnhub) is a significant negative factor, contributing to the price decline.  While Apple is boosting iPhone trade-in discounts in China (Yahoo), this measure may not be sufficient to offset the impact of potential tariffs.  The structured data reveals considerable uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding Apple, outweighing positive news such as Apple's India expansion (Yahoo).  My current portfolio shows a loss on AAPL, suggesting a need for a decisive action to mitigate further losses.
