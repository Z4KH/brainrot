Justification:  Apple's stock price has been steadily declining over the past week, from $211.45 on 05-15-2025 to $202.09 on 05-21-2025.  Multiple news sources cite concerns regarding Apple's AI strategy, competition from OpenAI (which recently acquired Jony Ive's company for $6.5 billion), and potential regulatory issues related to a deal with Alibaba.  These negative factors, coupled with the overall market downturn indicated by the Dow's worst day in a month, suggest further short-term price decline is likely.  While the portfolio currently shows a profit on AAPL, the risk of further losses outweighs the potential for short-term gains.
