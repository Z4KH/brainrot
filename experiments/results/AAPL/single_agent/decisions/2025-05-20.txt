Justification:  The recent price history shows a downward trend for AAPL, with the price dropping from $212.33 on 05-14-2025 to $206.86 on 05-20-2025.  While the portfolio currently shows a profit on AAPL, the negative momentum suggests further price decline is likely in the short term.  Multiple news sources mention ongoing trade tensions and scrutiny of Apple's dealings in China, which could negatively impact the stock price.  The return of Fortnite to the App Store is positive news, but it's unclear if this will significantly impact the stock price within the one-day timeframe.  The overall sentiment from news sources is mixed, but the negative price trend outweighs the positive news in the short term.
