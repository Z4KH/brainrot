Justification:  Apple's stock price has shown a consistent downward trend over the past few days ($213.04 on 05-01-2025, $205.08 on 05-02-2025, and $198.63 on 05-05-2025).  The portfolio currently holds 1500 shares purchased at $205.08, resulting in a loss. While some news sources highlight positive aspects like Morgan Stanley's overweight rating and strong Q1 earnings, other sources express concerns about tariffs, impacting profitability by $900 million in the June quarter, and a "muddier outlook".  The conflicting signals and the clear downward price trend suggest a continuation of the negative trend in the short term.  The recent bond offering and legal challenges further add to the uncertainty.
