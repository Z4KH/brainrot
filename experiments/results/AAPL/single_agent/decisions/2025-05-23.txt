Justification:  Apple (AAPL) has experienced a significant price drop over the past five days, from $208.78 to $195.27, a decrease of over 6%.  The recent price history shows a clear downward trend.  Multiple news sources report President Trump's renewed threats of imposing a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured abroad. This negative news, coupled with the already existing downward trend, suggests further short-term price declines are likely.  My current portfolio holds AAPL at a loss, providing an opportunity to minimize losses by selling.  While there is some positive news regarding Apple's AI initiatives and developer access, the immediate impact of the tariff threat outweighs these factors in the short-term.
