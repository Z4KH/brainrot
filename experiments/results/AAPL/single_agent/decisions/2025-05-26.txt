Justification:  Apple's stock price has been declining recently, dropping from $208.78 on 05-19-2025 to $195.27 on 05-23-2025.  The current portfolio holds 106 shares purchased at $197.52, resulting in a loss.  Multiple news sources (Yahoo, MarketWatch, Finnhub) report President Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the US. This negative news, coupled with the recent price decline, suggests further short-term downward pressure.  While some sources mention positive market movements due to tariff delays, the direct threat against Apple outweighs these broader trends in the short-term context.  The structured data lacks strong bullish signals for a one-day turnaround.
