Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight upward trend after a period of decline.  While the price is still below its high on May 2nd ($205.08), the current price ($197.23) suggests a potential short-term rebound.  Multiple news sources mention Apple's ongoing development in AI, including specialized chips for smart glasses and AI servers, and its potential to disrupt Google's search dominance.  These developments could positively impact investor sentiment and drive the stock price higher in the short term.  However, there are also counterpoints, such as legal challenges and tariff concerns, which introduce uncertainty.  The portfolio currently holds no AAPL shares, presenting an opportunity to capitalize on a potential short-term price increase.
