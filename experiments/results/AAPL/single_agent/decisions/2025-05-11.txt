Justification:  The current portfolio shows a profit on AAPL holdings. Recent price history reveals a slight downward trend, followed by a minor uptick to the current price of $198.27.  The structured data contains mixed signals; some sources suggest potential for growth ("Berkshire Hathaway Is Prepared For A Recession And That's When Fortunes Are Made", "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among Billionaire Bruce Berkowitz's Stock Picks with Highest Upside Potential"), while others express concerns about tariffs impacting Apple's profitability and the potential threat of AI-powered search engines to Google's (and by extension, Apple's) revenue streams ("President Trump's Tariffs Could Cost Apple Nearly $1 Billion", "AI's Threat to Google Just Got Real").  Given the short time horizon and the relatively small recent price fluctuations, a significant price movement in either direction is unlikely.  The existing profit warrants a cautious approach.
