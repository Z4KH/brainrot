Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight upward trend after a dip on 05-23-2025.  However, the structured data reveals significant negative sentiment towards AAPL due to President Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the US.  While some analysts maintain a buy rating and predict limited impact, the overwhelming negative news and the potential for significant price drops due to tariffs outweigh the short-term upward trend.  The portfolio currently holds no AAPL shares, allowing for a short-term bearish position.
