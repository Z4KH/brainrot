Justification:  Apple's stock price has dropped from $213.04 on 05-01-2025 to $205.08 on 05-02-2025, a significant decrease.  Multiple news sources (Yahoo, SeekingAlpha, Finnhub, MarketWatch) report on negative factors impacting Apple, including tariff concerns resulting in a projected $900 million cost increase and challenges in China.  While some sources suggest potential positive developments (AI partnerships, production shifts to India), the overall sentiment is negative, outweighing any potential short-term gains.  The portfolio currently holds 3000 shares purchased at $205.08, currently at a loss.  Given the negative news and recent price drop, a short-term sell is the most prudent action.
