Justification:  Apple's stock price dropped from $213.04 on 05-01-2025 to $205.08 on 05-02-2025, a significant decrease.  Multiple news sources cite concerns regarding tariffs impacting profitability (e.g., a projected $900 million hit in the June quarter),  growth struggles, and even downgrades from analysts.  While some sources highlight positive aspects like strong services revenue and continued interest from Warren Buffett, the prevailing sentiment expressed in the provided data leans negative, suggesting further short-term price decline is possible.  My current portfolio holds 4000 shares purchased at $205.08, currently at a loss.  Given the negative news and recent price action, a short-term sell position is warranted.
