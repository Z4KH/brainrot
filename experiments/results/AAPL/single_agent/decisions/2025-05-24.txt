Justification:  Apple's stock price has been declining over the past week, dropping from $208.78 on 05-19-2025 to $195.27 on 05-23-2025.  The structured data overwhelmingly points to President Trump's renewed tariff threats against Apple as the primary driver of this decline.  Multiple sources (Yahoo, MarketWatch, Finnhub) report Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the US, causing significant market apprehension.  While the portfolio currently holds AAPL at a loss, the potential for a short-term rebound based on market reaction to the news is considered.  The news is negative, but the speed and intensity of the price drop suggest a potential overreaction.
