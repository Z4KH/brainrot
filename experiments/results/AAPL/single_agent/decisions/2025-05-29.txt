Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight downward trend for AAPL, with the price fluctuating between $195.27 and $201.36 over the past week.  The current price of $199.95 is near the lower end of this range.  However, the news articles present a mixed picture. While some articles express concern about tariffs and reduced smartphone shipment forecasts, others highlight positive developments such as strong App Store billings and a potential surge in iPhone buying.  The appeals court decision temporarily rescuing Trump tariffs creates uncertainty, but the overall sentiment regarding Apple's AI capabilities and long-term prospects remains positive in several reports. Given the current price near the lower end of recent fluctuations and the potential for positive news to impact the price, a short-term buy position is considered.  The available portfolio balance allows for a significant purchase.
