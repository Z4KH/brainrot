Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight upward trend, with AAPL increasing from $199.95 on 05-29-2025 to $200.85 on 05-30-2025.  The portfolio currently holds 5000 shares at a profit. Several news sources mention President Trump's tariff threats against Apple, creating uncertainty. However, some articles also suggest a potential rebound due to court decisions blocking some tariffs and positive news regarding China shipments.  The overall sentiment is mixed, but the recent price increase and existing profit suggest a short-term holding strategy is prudent.
