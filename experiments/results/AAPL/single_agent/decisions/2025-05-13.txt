Justification:  Apple's stock price has shown a strong upward trend in the recent past, increasing from $195.99 on 05-07-2025 to $212.93 on 05-13-2025.  The portfolio currently holds 2250 shares purchased at $197.23, resulting in a profit.  While several news sources express mixed opinions on Apple's future prospects, with some highlighting potential tariff relief and others expressing concerns about competition and overvaluation, the recent price surge and positive portfolio position suggest a short-term bullish trend.  A JP Morgan buy rating with a $240 target price further supports this.
