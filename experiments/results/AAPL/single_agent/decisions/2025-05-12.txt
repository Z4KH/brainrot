Justification:  Apple's stock price has shown a significant upward trend in the last week, culminating in a substantial increase of $12.54 (5.2%) on 2025-05-12.  Multiple news sources cite potential price increases for iPhones, although Apple is attempting to avoid attributing this to tariffs.  The recent easing of US-China tariffs is also mentioned as a positive factor. While there are some concerns regarding Apple's services challenges and the impact of AI on search, the recent price surge and positive news regarding tariffs suggest a short-term bullish outlook.  The current portfolio holds a significant profit on AAPL, suggesting a potential opportunity to secure these gains.
