Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight downward trend for AAPL, with the price fluctuating between $210.79 and $212.93 over the past five days.  The current price of $211.26 is slightly below the recent high.  The portfolio currently holds 1225 shares of AAPL purchased at $198.39, resulting in a profit.  While several news sources mention President Trump's pressure on Apple regarding manufacturing locations (India vs. US), and the ongoing dispute with Epic Games over Fortnite, these factors do not provide a clear indication of short-term price movement.  The news is mixed, with some sources suggesting positive developments for Apple's supply chain and others highlighting potential challenges.  Given the slight downward trend and the existing profit, a cautious approach is warranted.
