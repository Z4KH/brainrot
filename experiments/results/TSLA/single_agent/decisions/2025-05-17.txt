Justification:  Tesla's stock price has shown a consistent upward trend over the past week, increasing from $318.38 on 05-12-2025 to $349.98 on 05-16-2025.  The recent news regarding the addition of a new board member (Jack Hartung) and ongoing discussions about CEO Elon Musk's compensation package suggest continued positive momentum. While some news sources mention concerns about declining sales and brand image, the overall sentiment in the provided data leans towards optimism, particularly given the recent stock price surge and positive market reaction to the pause in US-China tariff negotiations.  My current portfolio holds a profitable position in TSLA, providing a buffer against potential short-term losses.
