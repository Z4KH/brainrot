Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight downward trend, with TSLA closing at $339.34 on 2025-05-23 after a four-week winning streak.  Several news sources mention concerns about tariffs impacting Tesla and the broader market (DowJones, Yahoo, MarketWatch).  While some sources express bullish sentiment regarding Tesla's AI and autonomous vehicle prospects (Yahoo, Wedbush), the negative impact of tariffs and the recent price decline outweigh the positive projections.  The portfolio currently holds a profitable position in TSLA, providing an opportunity to secure profits.
