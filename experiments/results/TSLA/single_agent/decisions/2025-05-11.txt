Justification:  The recent price history shows a strong upward trend, with TSLA increasing from $280.26 on 05-05-2025 to $298.26 on 05-09-2025. While some news sources express concern about Tesla's sales and profitability (e.g., 71% profit drop, declining China sales, supplier layoffs), other sources highlight positive aspects such as the potential for robotaxis and continued interest from investors.  The current portfolio holds a profitable position in TSLA, suggesting a willingness to maintain exposure.  The overall sentiment is mixed, but the recent price action suggests continued short-term upward momentum.  Bill Miller's recommendation to sell TSLA is noted, but this is counter to the recent price trend and other bullish sentiment.
