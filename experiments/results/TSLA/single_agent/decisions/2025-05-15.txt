Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight downward trend after reaching a high of $347.68 on 05-14-2025.  The current price of $342.82 is still significantly higher than the price a week ago ($298.26). However, several news sources mention Third Point selling off its Tesla stake and a Tesla insider selling $198 million in shares.  While positive news exists regarding Optimus robot production and easing US-China trade tensions, the negative news regarding insider selling and a potential pullback in the tech sector warrants caution.  My current portfolio holds a profit on Tesla, suggesting a partial sell-off to secure profits is a prudent strategy given the mixed signals.
