Justification:  The recent price history shows a strong upward trend for TSLA, with a significant increase from $275.35 on 05-06-2025 to $318.38 on 05-12-2025.  Multiple news sources (DowJones, MarketWatch, Yahoo) report a bullish market rally driven by a US-China trade deal, directly mentioning TSLA's surge.  While some sources mention concerns regarding Tesla's safety and robotaxi plans, the overwhelmingly positive market sentiment and recent price action outweigh these concerns in the short-term context.  The current portfolio holds TSLA at a profit, providing a buffer against potential losses.
