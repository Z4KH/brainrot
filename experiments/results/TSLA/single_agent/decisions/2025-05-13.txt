Justification:  Tesla's stock price has shown a strong upward trend over the past week, increasing from $276.22 on 05-07-2025 to $334.07 on 05-13-2025.  The recent news regarding the Federal safety regulators' inquiry into Tesla's driverless taxis and slumping sales in China present some risk. However, numerous news sources highlight positive developments such as a potential US-China trade deal,  positive speculation about Tesla's upcoming robotaxi business, and a large Saudi investment pledge.  The current portfolio holds a profitable position in TSLA, suggesting a risk tolerance for further investment.  Given the recent upward momentum and positive news outweighing negative, a short-term buy is recommended.
