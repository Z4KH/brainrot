Justification:  The price of TSLA increased by approximately 2.4% from $280.52 on 05-01-2025 to $287.21 on 05-02-2025.  While the structured data contains mixed information regarding Tesla's performance and future prospects (including concerns about sales slumps in Europe, CEO uncertainty, and political backlash), several sources also highlight positive aspects such as the re-focus of Elon Musk on Tesla, potential for robotaxi service launch, and analyst predictions of upside potential. Given the recent price increase and the overall mixed but not overwhelmingly negative sentiment, a short-term buy position is considered.  The portfolio currently holds no TSLA shares, allowing for a full investment.
