Justification:  The recent price history shows a clear downward trend for TSLA, with the price dropping from $287.21 on May 2nd to $275.35 on May 6th.  Multiple news sources (Yahoo, Finnhub, MarketWatch) report significantly decreased sales in Europe, with drops ranging from 33% to 81% in various countries. This negative news, coupled with the existing loss in the portfolio, suggests further short-term decline.  While there is mention of a new Model Y launch and positive projections from some sources, the overwhelming negative sentiment regarding European sales outweighs these factors in the short-term context.
