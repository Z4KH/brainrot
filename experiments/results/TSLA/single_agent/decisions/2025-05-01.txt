Justification:  The news sentiment surrounding Tesla is overwhelmingly negative.  Multiple sources report on concerns regarding Tesla's robotaxi economics, competition from BYD and other Chinese EV manufacturers, and uncertainty surrounding Elon Musk's leadership and commitment to Tesla.  The single day's price history provides no indication of future movement. Given the negative news and lack of positive indicators, a short-term bearish stance is warranted.
