Justification:  The recent price history shows a slight downward trend, culminating in a 1.65% drop on 05-28-2025. However, the structured data reveals several potentially bullish factors.  The upcoming launch of the robotaxi service in Austin on June 12th is a significant positive catalyst, as highlighted by multiple sources (Yahoo, Bloomberg, Finnhub).  While concerns exist regarding Tesla's declining European sales and Elon Musk's time commitment (Yahoo, SeekingAlpha), the positive news regarding the robotaxi launch and Musk's stated refocus on Tesla (Yahoo) outweighs these negative factors in the short term.  The current portfolio holds a profit on TSLA, suggesting a risk-tolerant approach is justified.
