Justification:  The recent price history shows a consistent upward trend for TSLA, with the price increasing from $318.38 on 05-12-2025 to $349.98 on 05-16-2025.  Multiple news sources indicate positive sentiment towards Tesla, citing a fourth consecutive week of gains,  the addition of a new board member, and the overall positive market reaction to a pause in US-China tariffs.  While some sources mention concerns about sales numbers in China and potential issues with the Full Self-Driving package, the overwhelmingly positive news and the strong upward price momentum suggest a continuation of the upward trend in the short term.  The current portfolio holds a profitable position in TSLA, providing a buffer against potential losses.
