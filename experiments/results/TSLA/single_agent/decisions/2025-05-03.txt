Justification:  The price of TSLA has increased slightly from $280.52 on 05-01-2025 to $287.21 on 05-02-2025.  The provided news articles present a mixed outlook on Tesla. Some articles highlight positive aspects such as the potential for robotaxis and the company's position in the growing humanoid robotics market. However, other articles mention concerns about declining sales in Europe, insider selling, and the impact of Elon Musk's political involvement.  Given the current portfolio state showing a loss on the existing TSLA holdings, a wait-and-see approach is prudent to avoid further losses.  The lack of a clear, overwhelmingly positive trend in the news and the small price increase over the past two days do not justify a buy position.
