The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms"

The bulls are back on Wall Street, with good reason. The US and China have agreed to ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of meetings in Switzerland, the US will take reciprocal tariffs on China down to 10% from 125%. A separate tariff imposed by President Trump over what he says is China’s role in the fentanyl trade will stay intact. China will cut its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%. Stocks soared on the news, the US dollar caught a strong bid, and defensive plays such as gold sold off. Investors will now be looking for two things to keep the bullish vibes going: first, that the two economic superpowers signal there is an opportunity to take tariffs down even further after the 90-day pause; and second, that the tariffs aren’t hammering the US economy. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with eToro global markets analyst Lale Akoner on Opening Bid for perspective on whether stocks will be back for the rest of the year or if this is just a headfake. Akoner also discusses top picks in what is now a significantly changed backdrop for investors. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms"

The race to better compete with AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter Groq (GROQ.PVT). The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groq’s last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company’s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia’s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Ross to discuss his future plans for Groq. Ross is fresh off a trip with other key tech executives to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump in forging a deeper tech relationship with the country. Ross begins by sharing with Sozzi the conversations he had on the ground in Saudi Arabia. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.

The pros say the US–China tariff thaw is not a deal, but rather a thaw in the ordeal triggered by the Trump administration. Whatever it is, the stock market likes the fact that US tariffs on China will be going down to 30% from 145% for the next 90 days as US and China officials negotiate further. The verdict is out on several fronts, however. For one, tariffs are still in place on China, and there is no guarantee they will all be removed. There is also no guarantee that there won't be a renewed escalation. Two, the US economy has started to weaken in the face of considerable policy uncertainty, and experts are not ruling out a mild recession. What that means for Fed policy will likely dictate how stocks trade throughout the summer. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi welcomes former US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to the Opening Bid roundtable. Ross served in the first Trump administration when the then first-time president enacted tariffs. He has also known Trump for decades, gaining keen insight into how he operates on delicate matters. What's next in the trade war for investors? If there's anyone who might have an educated guess, it's business mogul turned policy expert Ross.
